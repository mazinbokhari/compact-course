<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Buildup to Entering World War I</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">America and Neutrality</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the early years of World War 1, Wilson declared America's neutrality in the war. Although the United States was officially declared neutral, most Americans sympathized with the Allies, including Britain and France, rather than Germany. The United States had and economic interest in the war and traded goods with Britain and France  with their neutral merchant ships. The United States' neutrality was not completely respected, and both the British and Germans harassed American merchant ships. The German submarines, known <span style="color: #007fff;">U-boats</span>, were infamous for the way they sunk enemy merchant ships on sight, and because the British sometimes flew the American flag on their ships to the fool the Germans, the Germans were forced into acting aggressively toward American merchant ships in most cases.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Sinking of the Lusitania</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The German U-boat harassment of American merchant ships made Americans frustrated with the Germans as it was, although their opposition for the Germans in the war was further elevated after German U-boats sunk a British passenger ships called The Lusitania in 1916, killing over 120 American passengers on board. After the incident, the Germans agreed to ensure the safety of he passengers on the ship that was sunk. The Germans also made other actions to restrict the tactics used in aggression to foreign ships, although such restriction were raised once the war situation was far against the favor of the Germans in 1917. The previous German change of action further pushed the prospect of the United States joining the war, which the Germans knew although they hoped to end the war before that could happen. Wilson won reelection on the slogan "He Kept Us Out of War", although he even allowed for the beginning of a mild military preparedness program to facilitate the United States joining the war if necessary in 1915.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Zimmerman Note</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The final straw that ultimately made the U.S. join the war was an intercepted message sent by Germany that was intended for Mexico to read, stating that they wanted their support in the war effort against Britain and France and that if they comied, Germany would help Mexico take back some of the territory it lost to the United States. Unrestricted submarine warfare was also at its peak at the time, giving all the more reason for the U.S. to join the war out of its extreme frustration. In 1917, Wilson officially declared war on Germany, and the United States began to mobilize in the war effort. The War Industries Board was established to handle the trade of war goods for the Allies, and a draft was issued in order to collect the necessary amount of troops.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">World War I and Post-War Events</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">War With Germany and Victory</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the Russians had to withdraw their effort in the war against Germany with the Allies after the<span style="color: #007fff;"> Bolshevik Revolution</span> and rise of the Communist Party, the Germans were then able to solely focus on fighting on the west side with Britain, France, and the U.S. The Germans unrestricted submarine warfare was having the intended effect on the Allies, and in response the U.S. began a vast project of ship construction. The American troops which numbered in the hundreds of thousands later in the war, were under the command of General John Pershing, and were able to withstand the final German offensive in the late years of the war and practically ensure a victory for the Allies. The peace conference at the end of the war made Wilson anxious to bring up his <span style="color: #007fff;">fourteen point plan</span>, which included the following concepts:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Freedom of the seas</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Minimization of tariffs and similar trade barriers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•An end to secret diplomacy</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•A reduction in military buildups in order to secure and ensure domestic safety</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•An adjustment of colonial claims</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Evacuation of foreign troops in other countries from the war</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Certain government adjustments in foreign European nations</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•An establishment of a collaborative world organization that would promote peace and reduce the risk of another future world war. That organization was to be called the <span style="color: #007fff;">League of Nations</span>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Peace Conference in Paris</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wilson went to the peace conference in Paris to propose and win approval for his fourteen point plan, although the rest of ht nations from the Allies were primarily concerned with revenge and dividing up territory from the lands they had defeated, while Wilson's focus was peace and the prevention of another such war in the future. Wilson's fourteen points were ignored for the most part, although he did win approval for the League of Nations. The Allies also agreed to make Germany pay a large sum in reparations, that would lead to their future economic depression and crisis which would put them in a desperate state for new leadership that would be granted by Adolf Hitler who would start World War 2.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Wilson's Opposition in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wilson returned the United States with the <span style="color: #007fff;">Treaty of Versailles</span>, which was widely criticized by Americans and politicians, especially Wilson's political Republican nemesis, Henry Cabot Lodge for its unjust conditions placed on Germany as well as the other Central Powers. Wilson's League of Nations was also criticized and viewed as a tool used by Wilson for reelection to a third term in 1918 while the League's actions wouldn't remotely serve the interests of the United States. Wilson strongly fought off all criticisms, and in his tour of speeches around the nation in order to rally support for his League of Nations, he was forced to retire his effort because of a stroke and health conditions. The Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles twice and instead negotiated a separate treaty with the defeated Central Powers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Red Scare</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the war, there was a widespread fear in America of the rise of the radical communists in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution. Americans feared that there were similar radicals in the United States that would overtake the government. During the scare, Attorney General <span style="color: #007fff;">Mitchell Palmer</span> accused multiple Americans and government officiasl of having affiliation with the communists party, and many of the suspected were jailed despite a large lack of evidence. Since their was such a lack of evidence for these individuals convictions, they were eventually released. The size and magnitude of the Red Scare was further expanded by the rise of labor unions after the war. The labor unions at the time were effectively using tactics known as collective bargaining, which entailed a group of employees negotiating with their employees about conditions or other requests. However, as time went on, the relationship between businesses and workers became worse due to the elevation of prices in goods while worker's wages stayed the same. This triggered many strikes that spread across the nation, giving labor unions a bad reputation, and also making Americans to see them in a more unpatriotic or un-American light.</p>

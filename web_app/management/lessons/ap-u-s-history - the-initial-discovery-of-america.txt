<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Origins of the First Settlers of America</h2>
The original natives of the Americas entered the Americas around 40,000 B.C. by crossing over the Bering Strait from what is now Serbia. By the time Columbus arrived in America, there were about 50 million natives spread across the land. The Native Americans at that time had a wide range of cultures, although different groups had their own established settlements and skill in hunting and fishing as a method to obtain food. The natives practiced their distinctive crafts and some had domesticated animals.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;">European Exploration and Settlement</span></h2>
In the early 1400s and 1500s, the period of the <span style="color: #007fff;">Renaissance</span> had an influence on the population of Europe. As the interest in technology and art increased in the nations and religious conflicts occurred, Europeans were given a deeper incentive to explore and discover new land. Such religious disputes left the majority of Spain and Portugal Catholic, while leaving the English Protestant. The Spanish desired to find a new route to China due to Ottoman presence in the east Asian coast, so they wished to explore in order to expand their foreign trade.
<h3>Columbus</h3>
Columbus, a native Italian explorer, tried finding such a route for trading with the Chinese under an agreement with the Spaniards. On his expedition, he believed he reached China, although it turns out that he instead reached the shores of the Americas. Long past Columbus' death when he still believed he discovered a new path to China in 1506, European transportation to the Americas had permanently been established. The Europeans and the Native Americans made trades and exchanges upon their interactions, however Europeans brought numerous diseases to the Americas that wiped out a significant number of the Native American population.
<h3>Spanish Settlement in the Americas</h3>
The Spanish mainly settled in southern and central America, and they shipped large amounts of gold and silver back to Spain, making them one of the powerful countries in continent. The Spanish sought to conquer all lands they discovered and also used the natives in these lands as labor slaves for Spaniards who settled in the "New World", making them work their land in return for minimal care. As the number of Native Americans available for conversion to slaves dwindled, the Spanish began importing slaves from Africa.
<h3>French Settlement in the Americas</h3>
The French settled and exploration areas that were mainly concentrated in northeastern Canada in what is now known as Quebec, as well as other eastern land such as Louisiana and areas along the Mississippi River. French Catholic preachers were sent to the new land with the goal of converting the natives' religious loyalties, although their efforts normally resulted in violence. Many French settlers were fur traders due to their lack of encounters with precious metals. The French were also known to have more peaceful and friendly relations with the natives, treating them as allies, with some even taking Native Americans as spouses.
<h3>English Settlement in the Americas</h3>
In the 1500s, the English began attempts of settling the eastern coast of the Americas as well. As the met the Native of America, they at first engaged in friendly exchange of goods and and teachings from the natives. As time elapsed, the english became close minded to the Native American culture, viewing them as inferior and savage, which gave way to violence and the natives feeling that their way of life was threatened by further settlements of the English. As the English migrated to America, their ships clashed with the Spanish navy in the Atlantic ocean, and their victories made them known as a significant naval power. Sir Walter Raleigh lead the first significant attempt of an English settlement at <span style="color: #007fff;">Roanoke Island</span> in 1587, although the venture ended in a failure. The English once again tried settling in the early 1600s, although their poor economy was proving to be an obstacle for such efforts. In order to overcome this setback, the creation of joint-stock companies became popular where multiple middle class English individuals could pool their finances into a larger venture for a settlement in the Americas that had promises for profit.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Colonization</h2>
<h3>Jamestown</h3>
In 1607, King James 1 of England gave a charter to a joint-stock company, known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Virginia Company</span>, for purposes of settling in the Atlantic coast of America. The early years of the settlement were hardly prosperous, with Indian attacks, sickness, and lack of food posing as a threat to the settlement in becoming a failure. <span style="color: #007fff;">John Smith</span>'s powerful leadership whipped the men of the company back into shape, making them more efficient and hard working, which enabled the survival of the settlement.  <span style="color: #007fff;">John Rolfe</span> introduced growing and selling tobacco as means for making profit in the colonies through its sales in England. The introduction of large tobacco plantations demanded a large workforce, which brought about the prospect of indentured servitude, where individuals would be brought to the colony to work with promises of land after the worked for the amount of time specified in a contract. Politically, the colony was significant because of its establishment of the <span style="color: #000000;">House of Burgesses</span>; a form of representative government between the colonists and the government of England. Due to financial problems, the Virginia Company lost its charter and Jamestown fell under the direct control of King James I, making Jamestown the first royal colony.
<h3>The Puritans and the Massachusetts Bay Colony</h3>
The Puritans were a religious group that wanted to "purify" the English Anglican Church from any Roman Catholic influence which they considered "unclean". The Massachusetts Bay Company, consisting of a group of Puritans , was given a charter by King Charles I to form the Massachusetts Bay Colony in America under the leadership of <span style="color: #007fff;">John Winthrop</span>. Their motive was to gain religious freedom in the new land and to further cleanse the Anglican church in their new colony. In the 1630s, a civil war in England drew thousands of English settlers to the colony. This movement of settlers to the Massachusetts Bay Colony is called <span style="color: #007fff;">The Great Migration</span>.
<h3>The Pilgrims and the Plymouth Colony</h3>
The Pilgrims were another religious group interested in colonizing in the new world for religious freedom, although unlike the Puritans, they wanted to separate from the church of England completely, giving them their name, the Separatists. The Pilgrims received a charter from the London Company for settling south of the Hudson River. Before arriving in their designated land, the Pilgrims signed a document known as the Mayflower Compact which established their own form of self-government. On their voyage aboard the <span style="color: #007fff;">Mayflower</span> they were blown off course to Cape Cod. Their survival mainly depended on the aid of the Native Americans.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Gilded Age</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The gilded age was the period mainly marked between the late 1870s up until 1900. The Gilded Age was an era were laissez-faire dominated economics and the very small amount of the population that included the wealthiest of the most wealthy American businessmen who emerged from cutthroat competition had a very large amount of power in the country.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Politics</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The courts at the time narrowly interpreted the constitution, which made it difficult for any reforming or regulatory legislation to be passed and in effect made it very easy for limited government intervention and laissez-faire to continue. In elections, both Democrats and Republicans refrained from taking strong stances on issues, and also the Republicans continued on the post-Civil war of "waving the bloody shirt" to rally voters against the Democrats who caused the war and so much loss for the dear Union. Since not much happened politically in government, a game of <span style="color: #007fff;">patronage</span> became a big part of politics, which was basically a competition between and within parties to assign and hold government positions and offices. Republicans who didn't involve themselves in this game of patronage were known as "<span style="color: #007fff;">mugwumps</span>". Presidential administration during the Gilded Age included those of Rutherford B. Hayes who won the election of 1876, James Garfield who won the election of 18880, and Chester A. Arthur who was placed into the presidential office in 1881. Upon taking the office, Garfield was swarmed by people requesting government positions. When he was about to leave on vacation, a distressed person who was desperate for an office position, but had not gotten one yet shot president Garfield in the back, making vice president Chester A. Arthur the next president of the United States in 1881.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The election of 1884</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland, won the election of 1884, marking a small comeback for the Democratic party.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Reform in Politics</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The end of the overwhelming amount of patronage that was taking place in politics was facilitated by the enactment of the <span style="color: #007fff;">Pendleton Act of 1881</span> by the Civil Service Commission.  The act made it mandatory for people to take a specific test in order to hold certain government positions or jobs.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tariffs</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One large issue in the gilded age, especially during 1880, was the subject of tariffs. Tariffs were very high, which was eliminating foreign competition and thus allowing American companies to charge even more for their own goods. Farmers also complained about high tariffs because European countries would often respond to high U.S tariffs by putting their own taxes on farming imports from the U.S., causing American farmers to loss some of their businesses.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Money</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Debate Over Currency</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Farmers waned more money in circulation so that they could invest in new land at a lower interest rate, also, an increase in the amount of money in circulation would allow them to pay off their debts more easily since the currency would be inflated later on. Their way of setting this situation into effect was by supporting the minting of a large amount of soft money,  or silver coins. The bankers wanted the opposite to happen, and instead were strong advocated of a limited hard currency that would be backed by the gold in order to preserve its value.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Greenback Party</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other people supported the minting of paper money that wouldn't be backed by gold or silver, and such people formed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Greenback Party</span>. Once the economic crisis during the 1870s ended, the Greenback Party dissolved although there were still many people in favor of increasing the amount of money in circulation for their own possible benefit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The election of 1888</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Republican candidate, Benjamin Harrison, defeated the Democrat Cleveland for election to the presidential office in 1888.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Harrison's Billion Dollar Congress</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Harrison president marked the first that Congress surpassed over a billion dollars on its budget. With the large budget, the Harrison's Congress accomplished the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•The high tariff known as the McKinley Tariff of 1890</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Additional pension payments to war veterans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•<span style="color: #007fff;">The Sherman Antitrust Act</span> which banned the formation of trust or another sort of conspiracy amongst companies in order to interfere with the natural competition of trade</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Economy</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Railroads</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was a dispute over the regulation of railroads, for certain railroads were charging more or less for certain passengers, and the railroads argued they were in the right under the "due process clause" In the supreme court, it was declared that the people had the ability to regulate the railroads in such a way and thus the railroads were defeated in the matter. Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Clause which established the Interstate Commerce Commission which regulated railroads and transportation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Big Business</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">John Rockefeller and his large <span style="color: #007fff;">Standard Oil Company</span> had trusts with other oil companies in order to eliminate competition with other companies. Ultimately trusts, would become monopolies that dominated the industry, and the idea of owning all the other companies in a single industry was also known as <span style="color: #007fff;">horizontal integration</span>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Populist Party</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The rise of the people's party or the <span style="color: #007fff;">Populist Party</span>, was mainly made successful due to the widespread amount of support it received from farmers. The party wanted to shift the concentration of power away from the rich merchants and bankers. The Populist Party drafted the Omaha Platform which called for government regulation of railroads, the minting of silver, immigration reform, and shorter workdays. Basically the Populist party wanted to end the laissez-faire style capitalism that had been ruling the economy at that time.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Sherman Silver Purchase Act</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the panic of 1893, President Cleveland attempted to deal with the crisis by championed the gold standard. A decrease in silver prices made a lot of people convert over to the gold currency, and Cleveland responded by repealing the Sherman Silver Purchase  Act which mandated the purchase of a specific amount of silver every month.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Election of 1896</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the election of 1896, the Populist Party supported <span style="color: #007fff;">William Jennings Bryan</span> as their candidate after his inspiring "Cross of Gold" speech that effectively conveyed the concerns and goals of the Populist Party. The Republican Party nominated William McKinley as their candidate who supported the gold standard as well as a high tariff in order to protect American industry and manufacturing. Bryan received the majority of his support from the western and southern regions of America, although the manufacturing centers of the nation gave McKinley their solid support, causing him to win the election. After losing the election of 1896, the Populist Party pretty much disappeared.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">French Revolution</h2>
France was almost bankrupt; inflation, unemployment and famine were destroying the country. The was complete social rigidity. The Church and Aristocracy were not taxable due to laws. The middle class had education and wealth, but were unable to be considered in the social elite. The enlightenment ideas strengthened the notion that the current government was unfair.

A national assembly, the Estates General, met with Louis XVI expecting serious change. Neither side was willing to compromise. The disgruntled formed a new assembly the National Assembly. They demanded a fair constitution. The Assembly guaranteed themselves civil liberties with the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen. Special privilege was removed. A counter-revolution was planned. Other countries wanted to stop the revolution, so that they weren't forced to cede power. The groups now in control had clashing desires.

France went to war with neighboring countries. The economy took a turn for the worse and many battles were lost. The king was stripped of all powers. The radical Jacobin party took control in the next elections. The created the Committee of Public Safety which assumed power. To keep up the wars a draft was instituted. The Jacobins led mass hunts trying to get rid of traitors and counterrevolutionaries. This was known as the Reign of Terror. Public executions were common. A moderate government known as the Directory took power, but was overthrown five years later.

Napoleon Bonaparte seized power with the fall of the Directory. He created a dictatorship. He continued the current wars. The French conquered almost all of Europe (Britain and Russia remained). British naval power and Russia's schorched-earth tactic led to the demise of French military dominance. Napoleon was exiled, but returned only to be stopped again. France was modernized under his rule. He created a national bank and a modern law code. The old royal family gained power after Napoleon's death.

Charles Darwin created the Theory of Evolution. Albert Einstein created the Theory of Relativity, the first challenge to Newtonian Physics. Sigmund Freud started the field of Psychology.

A jewish officer was blamed for leaking French military secrets to Germany in an incident known as the Dreyfus Affair. Women started to gain status.

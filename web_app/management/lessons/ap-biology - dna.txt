There are several very important things that needed to be known about DNA for the AP exam. The AP frequently asks application questions on the multiple choice on mutations of proteins based on genetic code; on the free response the processes of DNA replication, transcription and translation become the main focus. Operons are another topic which I foresee being asked about on the free response in years to come. Lets get back to the basics for a momentâ€¦What is DNA?
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">DNA Overview</span></h2>
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the most common genetic material used in eukaryotes. It has a twisted double helix structure with side chains made up of phosphate-sugars and the two chains connected in the middle by nucleic bases. There are two classes of bases. <span style="color: #007fff;">Purines</span> are one type and the bases that are most common are <span style="color: #007fff;">adenine</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">guanine</span>. <span style="color: #007fff;">Pyrimidines</span> are the other type of base; the main bases are <span style="color: #007fff;">cytosine</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">thymine</span>. ***Note- when pairing bases, adenine ALWAYS has to go with thymine and guanine ALWAYS has to go with cytosine. They wont pair in any other fashion in DNA.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Replicating DNA</span></h2>
Replicating DNA is basically the way DNA copy's itself before the cell enters mitosis. It is a fast and accurate process that involves many different enzymes and proteins. Replication begins a special points called <span style="color: #007fff;">origins of replication</span>. These points are where a special enzyme called <span style="color: #007fff;">helicase</span> unwinds the double helix forming an elliptical DNA "bubble." The two ends of this bubble are called <span style="color: #007fff;">replication forks</span>. Downstream past both replication forks, enzymes called <span style="color: #007fff;">topoisomerases</span> keep the DNA from twisting or breaking during replication. A couple more terms need to be known before we jump into the active coping process. In DNA, each nucleotide is attached to its own phosphate group at its 5' carbon and connects to the adjacent nucleotide at the 3' carbon. Finally, in DNA replication there is a leading strand and a lagging stand. I will clear this up below as to what these two terms actually mean.

The actual process of copying DNA begins with the placement of a<span style="color: #007fff;"> RNA primer</span> by the enzyme <span style="color: #007fff;">primase</span>. This primer is critical to starting the new strand and later will be replaced by actual DNA code. <span style="color: #007fff;">DNA polymerase III</span> is the main enzyme that copies the DNA onto a new strand. <em><strong>*** Polymerase only replicates DNA in the 5' to 3' direction</strong></em>. Usually what will happen is that the primer will be placed in the center of the strands; in the bubble, each strand runs antiparallel, so the top strand will go 5' to 3' from left to right while the bottom will go 5' to 3' right to left.

The <span style="color: #007fff;">leading strand</span> will be a continuous strand that is copied in the 5' to 3' direction from the primer to the replication fork. The lagging strand will sit behind the leading strand and will be built from several shorter segment of DNA called<span style="color: #007fff;"> Okazaki fragments</span>. They are formed in the 5' to 3' direction from the replication fork back to the primer in the center of the bubble strand. Each okazaki fragment requires a primer to start it. The leading and lagging strand are bound after <span style="color: #007fff;">DNA polymerase I</span> replaces the primers with <span style="color: #007fff;">DNA ligase</span> seals the fragments together.

Errors in replication are prevented by proofreading done by DNA polymerase and other enzymes. Damaged DNA is cut out by <span style="color: #007fff;">nuclease</span> (another enzyme) and the fix is made by polymerase and ligase. Yep, thats about it...wait. One more thing. TELOMERES!!!

As DNA is replicated, it also is slowly degraded and shortened because polymerase cannot attach more DNA to the 5' end of the strands. <span style="color: #007fff;">Telomeres</span> solve this problem. They are multiple repetions of some short nucelotide sequence. Telomerase is the enzyme that lengthens telomeres after polymerase creates them.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Transcription: DNA to RNA</span></h2>
<span style="color: #007fff;">Transcription</span> is the process of transferring genetic code from DNA to RNA. This will serve as a template for the creation of proteins later in <span style="color: #007fff;">translation</span>. RNA is different from DNA- it uses ribose as its sugar, it is single stranded, and thymine is replaced by a different base called Uracil. Transcription happens in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; the difference lies between them in that prokaryotes can transcribe DNA instantaneously while in eukaryotes the RNA that is created must travel outside the nucleus after being produced.

The type of RNA created from transcription is called <span style="color: #007fff;">messenger RNA</span> or <span style="color: #007fff;">mRNA</span>. Transcription starts at a special DNA sequence called the promoter. <span style="color: #007fff;">RNA polymerase</span> binds to the promoter and starts the whole show. At the other end of the process, a squence of nucleotides called the terminator signals RNA polymerase to stop. There are a couple other structures that make sure RNA transcription occurs at the right place. <span style="color: #007fff;">Transcription factors</span> exist in eukaryotes that bind to the promoter and attract the polymerase to it. The polymerase unwinds the helix at the promoterand joins the complimentary nucleotides to the 3'end  of the mRNA strand. Once the polymerase hits the terminator, it releases the DNA and the helix structure reforms.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">mRNA Modification</span></h2>
Two things are added to mRNA to prevent degredation of code after the strand travels outside of the nucleus. A <span style="color: #007fff;">poly-A tail</span> is added to the 3' end while a string of guanine nucleotides are added to the 5' end; its called a 5' cap. Additionally, these two additions may help with the strands attachment to ribosomes.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Splicing RNA</span></h2>
DNA is more complex in eukaryotes. One of its special qualities are its long and numerous non coding section called <span style="color: #007fff;">introns</span>. The stretches of code that are actually expressed and synthesized into proteins are called <span style="color: #007fff;">exons</span>. RNA splicing is the process of cutting out the introns out of a strand of pre-mRNA and joining the remaining exons. <span style="color: #007fff;">Spliceosomes</span> are special protein complex that carry out this splicing.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Translation: mRNA to Proteins</span></h2>
Translation occurs when mRNA meets tRNA, or transfer RNA. Side note- tRNA is synthesized in the nucleus and moves to the cytoplasm where it is repeatedly used. tRNA carries required amino acids to ribosomes as a ribosome attaches to and reads a strand of mRNA. This whole process is centered around the reading of <span style="color: #007fff;">codons</span>. Codons are units of three nucleotides that are grouped together and read, almost like a letter. There can be multiple codons for one amino acid; its up to the tRNA to recognize the right one.

Ribosomes are where the actual reading of codons occurs. There are two subunits of a ribosome that come together to be the facility of translation. These subunits come together when they attach to a mRNA stand. There are three spots that the top unit of a ribosome contains; the bottom unit holds and moves the mRNA while the top reads (kind of). The <span style="color: #007fff;">P-site</span> holds the tRNA holding the growing amino acid chain; the <span style="color: #007fff;">A-site</span> holds the tRNA carrying the next amino acid; the <span style="color: #007fff;">E-site</span> is where the tRNA is released. When the tRNA molecules shift from right to left, the growing amino acid chain is moved to the tRNA in the P-site.

The construction of the polypeptide occurs when a <span style="color: #007fff;">start codon </span>is read; it stops when a <span style="color: #007fff;">stop codon</span> (UAA/UGA/UAG) is read.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Mutations</span></h2>
Questions about these occurs fairly often on the multiple choice. A mutation is a change in genetic information; it involves either large very significant changes or small unnoticeable ones. There are several types of mutations one should be familiar with...
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;">base-pair substitutions: one nucleotide and its compliment are substituted for another pair.</span></li>
	<li>missense: a mutation that occurs causing an incorrect amino action do be added</li>
	<li>point mutations: change that affects only one pair of nucleotides</li>
	<li>nonsense: point mutations cause a amino acid codon to become a stop codon, stopping polypeptide creation.</li>
	<li>frameshift: mutations that involve the deletion or addition of a nucleotide pair that do not occur in groups of threes</li>
</ul>
The danger of these mutations depends on where they happen in a codon and how they affect the proteins overall stucture.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Operons</span></h2>
I don't think they will ask you very much if anything at all, but its good to know this concept just in case. The proteins an organism produces comes from the reading of genetic code. Many organisms adjust to changes in their environment; this may cause a need for different proteins. These organisms are able to shift the reading of genetic code to synthesize new proteins due to <span style="color: #007fff;">operons</span>. Operons are like on and off switches for patches of exons and access to them is regulated by the same principles as feedback control. Operons have a promoter and an <span style="color: #007fff;">operator</span>, a gate which is opened and closed in response to environmental changes. The operator is opened and closed by a <span style="color: #007fff;">repressor</span>, the molecule being responded to. Downstream from the repressor lies the genes needed to produce different proteins. And...that's all folks. Now go numb your mind with tv, because that my friend was a lot of reading. :)

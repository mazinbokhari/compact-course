<h2 style="text-align: center;">Technological and Societal Prerequisites</h2>
The Enclosure Acts in England took common land used for grazing and gave it to wealthy landowners. Poor farmers had no way of surveying and moved into the cities. This provided a large new workforce.

James Watt invented the steam engine. The steam engine allowed for steam ships and trains. This greatly improved transportation. The steam engine could also power machines.

England took an early lead in industrialization due to it's geography and wealth. The English had greatly profited from it imperialistic ambitions. A large capital allowed for investments in new infrastructure and machines. England was rich in coal, which was the main fuel source at the time. England had many rivers that could be used to transport raw materials with relative ease.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Impact of Industrialization</h2>
Britain's economy skyrocketed with industrialization. Textiles were produced at rapid rates. Industrialized nations needed more raw resources so colonies were further exploited. The manufactured goods would then be sold back to the colonies. Weapons were also being mass produced. These weapons made it easier for industrialized nations to dominate developing nations. Steamships made travel incredibly faster. Naval bases were set up all over the world. Deals were created to exploit native populations to develop one resource; only a small elite group would benefit. Without the higher demand for raw materials like cotton due to industrialization, slavery may have died away; instead many more were enslaved so the demand could be satisfied.

Poor women often got jobs at textile factories. Women received much less pay then male counterparts. Very few middle or upper class women worked. Sewing machines allowed for women to have free time they could spend outside the home, which allowed for the feminism movements. Better medicine allowed for more women to survive childbirth.

Cities rapidly grew. Cities could not handle rapid growth, so they often became dirty, overcrowded and disease-ridden. Still the population greatly increased as people began to live longer due to better medicines. Pollution was a large problem as there were no laws stopping it.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Important Innovations</h2>
Communication was greatly improved by the invention of the telegraph and later the telephone and radio. The bessemer process allowed for the cheeper production of steel. The availability of quality steel allowed for the expansion of the railroad. The process of vulcanizing rubber was found and tires could be made. The internal combustion engine was invented. The tractor allowed for agriculture  to become more efficient. The Wright brothers created the airplane. The cotton gin allowed for cotton to be cleaned by machine. The idea of interchangeable parts was incepted by Samuel Colt, while improving the rifle.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Economic Theories</h2>
Adam Smith created capitalism in his book the Wealth of Nations. He stated the goal of any economy is the most efficient use of resources. He said this could best be achieved through market forces. He said that if there is a demand someone would supply for it. He called this the invisible hand. Adam Smith believed in competition stating it would bring advancement. David Ricardo stated that employers would always exploit their employees, paying them just what is needed to survive. This is referred to as Ricardo's Iron Law of Wages.

Workers often wanted better working conditions and pay. They bound together in unions. There was strict legal opposition to unions, yet workers joined to fight for their rights. Socialists rejected the notion of private property. Karl Marx saw the struggles of the poor.  He believed one day the lower classes would unite, have a violent revolution and be their own rulers. He came up with the idea of communism: a system of equality and prosperity.

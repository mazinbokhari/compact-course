<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gerald Ford's Presidency</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gerald Ford occupied the office of presidency by replacing Spiro Agnew as vice president upon his resignation, and then replacing Nixon upon his resignation. His vice president was Nelson Rockefeller. Ford granted Nixon an unconditional pardon on the crimes and corruption that he may have been involved with. Ford's action spared trials although people criticized him for sympathizing for an unjust cause, and thus he lost popularity. Ford and Congress clashed over their ideas on how to battle the recession, for Ford thought the issues were rooted in foreign oil dependency and the low purchasing power of the dollar. Ford attempted to continue Nixon's approach on foreign policy, although lack of cooperation from Congress allowed more Asian countries to fall to communism.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> Iranian Hostage Crisis</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States was in support of the Shah of Iran, and the two had become allies. The influence of the U.S. on the Shah made him more open westernizing Iran, which many Iranian nationalists thought was a dig race to the tradition of their country and culture. Once the U.S. took in the Shah to help give him medical aid amid his illness, these Iranian nationalists became furious, and in their rage, captured 63 Americans from the U.S. embassy in Iran and held them hostage, which became the event known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Iranian hostage crisis</span>. Negotiations on behalf of the U.S. were mainly unsuccessful, even military operations were attempted and failed, although the Iranians finally let the hostages go to an agreement shortly after Carter left office.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domestic Policy</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reagan was a Republican who was elected to office in 1980 as an ex-actor and another Washington outsider who used this in his campaign like Carter. He was a true conservative and his presidency marked the first conservative presidency since the 1920s. Reagan was able to champion the average American worker and reduce the size of government due to the Republican control in Congress.</p>
Reagan utilized the idea of supply side economics, where he combated the recession by lowering taxes that businesses would normally have to pay during the production of their products. his method worked, and his economic policy, also known as <span style="color: #007fff;">Reaganomics</span>, caused unemployment to drop in the U.S and mark the recovery that was taking place in the economy. Reagan also lowered personal income taxes so that consumers so that consumers had more money to spend and stimulate the economy. He also implemented food stamps and supported Medicare.

During the Reagan administration, business and industry became more deregulated in order to increase competition, lower the amount that businesses would have to spend by regulating their practices, which would lead to businesses being allowed to sell their goods for cheaper prices.

Reagan was also a strong advocate of increasing military defense spending, although he normally tried to shrink government size and its spending in most other forms. He came up with an idea for a missile defense system that was popular because of its absurdity, and was called the <span style="color: #007fff;">Strategic Defense Initiative</span>, or SDI, but more commonly referred to as "Star Wars" for the way the design included high tech-lasers and futuristic technology. Reagan attempted to cut spending on social programs, although Democrats refused to let that happen, so the budget defect actually increased due to the increase in defense spending while social spending wasn't reduced, even some programs, such as Medicare, grew.

However, the Democrats passed a law that prohibited the Reagan administration from continuing to provide the Contras with aid in Nicaragua. In a secret scheme that was carefully kept from the public, the Reagan Administration continued to aid the Contras with the money they received from selling weapons to the Iranians who were fighting Iraq, and these deals were also kept a secret. The whole scheme, known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Iran-Contra Affair</span>, was discovered by the American public, and was viewed as a disgraceful scandal that left a bad mark on the Reagan administration.
<h4 style="text-align: left;"> Grenada</h4>
One of Reagan's successes in foreign policy was the way he dealt with the rise of communism in Grenada. A group of Pro-Cuban people from grenada were about to form a military base on the island, although Reagan sent the military to intervene and foil their plans before the communist military base was established.

The force attack forced Iraq to surrender in just about 4 days, although Hussein remained in power, but the credit for brilliant foreign policy was given to Bush.
<h3 style="text-align: left;"> Domestic Policy</h3>
Social issues of the 1980s and 1990s included racial discrimination, affirmative action, and the amount of minorities that were occupying government offices, which was only on the rise at state levels rather than national levels at the time.

The 1986 Immigration Reform Act made all illegal aliens citizens, and the 1990 Immigration Act loosened the amount of restrictions on people who had special employment skills.

This chapter is really just knowing the processes one can utilize while working with and manipulating DNA. On the AP, these will almost always only show up on the multiple choice, if they show up at all. So, lets dive into biotechnology!!!
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Biotechnology Overview</span></h2>
Biotechnology is the application of genetic engineering where DNA and genetic materials are manipulated for some purpose. The DNA created from this application of engineering comes from various organisms  and is termed <span style="color: #007fff;">recombinant DNA</span>. An example of this would be manipulating bacterial DNA to get it to produce insulin needed for diabetes patients.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Bacteria: The Key to Manipulating DNA</span></h2>
The common method used to manipulate DNA is through special bacterial DNA called <span style="color: #007fff;">plasmids</span>. Plasmids are small circular pieces of DNA that bacteria have in them floating around. Their use consists of pulling these plasmids out of the bacteria cells, inserting desired genes into them, and then reinserting them into the bacteria so that they may replicate and become recombinant DNA. Furthermore, once the modified bacteria cell reproduces, more and more cells will have the capabilities of the original engineered bacteria cell.

The key part of the creation of recombinant DNA is how exactly the DNA is inserted. Special enzymes called <span style="color: #007fff;">restriction enzymes</span> are used to cut the plasmid to open it up. Restriction enzymes are very specialized and are only able to cut at specialized nucleotide sequences. These specialized sequences are called <span style="color: #007fff;">restriction sites</span>. When a cut is made at a restriction site, two possible openings are created. One opening is called a <span style="color: #007fff;">sticky end</span> and only occurs if the cut occurs ina staggered way. The other opening is called a <span style="color: #007fff;">blunt end</span>; this cut occurs straight through. ***Note- only sticky ends can fit with other sticky ends; the same goes for blunt ends. For sticky ends, it really depends on the orientation of the cut to see if two fragments will fit.  Finally, <span style="color: #007fff;">DNA ligase</span> is used to seal the fragments together.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Application of Genetic Engineering</span></h2>
There are several procedures used in biotechnology labs to harness the power of DNA cloning and recombination. The following includes important procedures or terms that are frequently used in genetic engineering:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">genomic library</span></span>: many times a large database of DNA is kept for reference and frequent use. A genomic library holds hundreds of plasmids, each one recombined with some inserted DNA from restriction enzymes. </span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">complimentary DNA</span>: this is DNA produced from mRNA through the use of reverse transcriptase, and enzyme that turns mRNA into DNA</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cDNA library</span>: a genomic library of cDNA</li>
</ul>
****Procedures...
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nucleic acid hybridization</span>: this is used to help find a gene of interest within a genomic library. Here, a nucleic acid probe, that has the complimentary sequences to the desired DNA segment, is radioactively labeled, so that it will glow. The cell under inspection will then be treated with heat to break open the cell and denature the DNA. Then, the probe can search and hybridize to the correct complimentary DNA fragment and glow. Thus the desired gene is found. </span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</span>: a common way to amplify DNA, meaning the quantity of a desired piece of DNA is created. This is a quick way to produce massive quantities of DNA. The gene of interest is added to a soluton of primers, heat-resistant DNA polymerase, and four nucleotides. The solution is then heated to open up the DNA, then cooled so the primers can H-bond to the complimentary code. Finally, the polymerase is added and it builds the complimentary sequence and attaches them to the 3' end of the primers. This short procedure is repeated many many times to amplify the DNA.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">gel electrophoresis</span>: a lab procedure that separates nucleic acids, DNA fragments, and proteins according to their size and charge. Remember, size is inversely proportional to distance traveled, so shorter fragments go farther in the gel. The whole apparatus used is based on an electric current driven through the gel. Since the DNA is negatively charged because of their phosphate groups, they move away from the negative side and toward the positive side.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Southern blotting</span>: a technique that combines gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid hybridization where fragments travel in gell and hen are transferred to another testing area, usually nitrocellulose paper where the desired gene is found through bonding with a complimentary strand that radioactively glows.</li>

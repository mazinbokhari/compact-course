Evolution is a topic that is one of the more important ones on the new format of the AP biology exam. It appears on both multiple choice and at least once on the free response. <span style="color: #007fff;">Evolution</span> can be looked at as a process of "<em>descent with modification,</em>" as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charles Darwin</span> put it. However, the father of evolution was not the first person to explore the idea of slow changes among populations of organisms.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">A brief history of Evolutionary theory</span></h2>
There is a lot more ideas and notable thinkers who contributed to evolutionary theory over time, but here i will just cover a few of them. In the 1700's, a scientist named Linnaeus created a binomial system for organizing organisms by their genus and species. He also created a heirarchy of groups to organize his binomial system further; essentially, Linnaeus founded <span style="color: #007fff;">taxonomy</span>, or the study of classifying organisms into groups. He laid the basis for our classification or organisms today.

Before Darwin came out with the currently accepted view of evolution, a man named Lamarck hypothesized that evolution occurs according to two rules. One, the use/disuse of body parts leads to their subsequent strength or weakness. Second, he stated that offspring can inherit traits that parents have acquired over time. This idea of acquired traits was later proved wrong by Darwin, but both of Lamarck's ideas were accepted as fact for quite some time.

Darwins theory of evolution, the currently accepted one, revolves around two ideas: <span style="color: #007fff;">adaptations</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">natural selection</span>. An adaptation is a change, either physical or behavioral, in an organism that helps it stay alive and pass on its genes through reproduction in a given environment. Natural selection is takes this idea of adaptations a step further. It states that the environment will change naturally and, in the process, some traits of organisms will be selected for. What does that even mean?!?!?! Well, it means that certain traits, like fur color or thickness will be more beneficial in the selecting environment. Thus, organisms possessing these traits will be able to produce more offspring than those without them.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">More about Darwin!</span></h2>
Darwin's theory consists of two main ideas. The first is descent with modification. He stated that this modification resulted in all the differences between organisms today. Furthermore, he argued that this linked all organisms to some very distant ancestor; the only reason organisms differentiated was due to environmental selection.

The second was natural selection. There are three key points that need to bee remembered about this concept. One, natural selection is a macroevolutionary principle, meaning it functions only on populations. Two, natural selection only acts on the gene pool available, it doesn't create new adaptations...it just chooses the best one from the variations available. Finally, natural selection is completely environmentally based.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Proof of Evolution</span></h2>
There are several different proofs for the theory of evolution:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Fossil Records: this keeps track of the differences between present and past organisms. These fossils have been examined in terms of anatomy and molecular makeup and have been used to link orgamisms together on a evolutionary level</span></li>
	<li>Homology: similarity of organisms based on common descent over time. The main sources of similarity are <span style="color: #007fff;">homologous structure</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;"><span style="color: #007fff;">vestigial</span> organs</span>. Homologous structures are those that have the same structural elements, but can have different functions. <span style="color: #007fff;">Vestigal organs</span> are structures that have slowly lost their purpose in an organism, but still link the organism to other animals that still display the organ. An example would be the the human appendix.</li>
	<li>Comparative embryology or Molecular genetic makeup: these provide a molecular and early developmental view of organisms and the similarities that lie between when compared</li>
	<li>Bio-geography: the influence of continental drift on the geographic species distribution. This helps in linking an organism of a specific environment to others that may have lived in similar ones before it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Population Evolution</span></h2>
Evolution is heavily based on sexual reproduction due to the genetic variability that it provides. Both <span style="color: #007fff;">genetic variation</span> and natural<span style="color: #007fff;"> mutation</span> create this variation within sexual reproduction. Genetic variations create the majority of different phenotypes that the environment can naturally select from. Mutations act a little differently. These changes in DNA sequences occur rarely, but when they do they're almost always harmful. Finally, its important to remember that steps in meiosis, like crossing over and independent assortment, add more variation that contributes to slow changes over time.

Now, these mechanisms may be a prerequisite to the change within evolution, but several things can regulate these changes and the rate at which they occur. The first on the list is <span style="color: #007fff;">natural selection</span>. Natural selection allows organisms with allele frequencies for more favorable traits to flourish, while those with the less favorable ones have less reproductive and survival "fitness."  Second, we have <span style="color: #007fff;">genetic drift</span>. This is a condition that only occurs in small populations, where chance causes massive and random changes in allele frequencies. Genetic drift is known as <span style="color: #007fff;">bottleneck effect</span> when a catastrophe reduces the population to a level that did not reflect the previous allele frequencies; <span style="color: #007fff;">flounder effect</span> is genetic drift among a small migratory population. Finally, <span style="color: #007fff;">gene flow</span>, or the movement of alleles between populations, can change allele frequencies as well.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Natural Selection: A closer Look</span></h2>
Natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism that consistently causes adaptive evolution and increase the population of organisms with the highest relative fitness in a certain environment. It's important to remember that natural selection acts on the whole organism and all its phenotypes, not just one or any genotypes.

There are three types of selection:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Directional selection</span> is where one allele may be favored, most frequently during environmental change. </span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Disruptive selection</span> favors the alleles at opposite ends of the phenotypic range, thus usually the heterozygotes suffer</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Stabilizing selection</span> favors the intermediate phenotypes and selects against the extremes</li>
</ul>
Although natural selection may act against some alleles, genetic variation is maintained through ecological factors and balancing selection, where frequencies of two or more phenotypes of a population can be maintained. Often times, frequency-dependent selection results as a phenotype becomes too common and the environment/ecosystem changes in response.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Speciation</span></h2>
<span style="color: #007fff;">Speciation</span> is the creation of new species from common ancestors; it increases biological diversity while maintaining unity between them. Speciation can occur through many different situations...

A species is defined by the <span style="color: #007fff;">biological species concept</span>, which states that a species is a group of populations that can interbreed naturally and produce viable (healthy) and fertile offspring, but cannot successfully mate with other species. The main mechanism causing speciation is <span style="color: #007fff;">reproductive isolation</span>. This means that two populations are separated by some kind of barrier for a necessary period of time, in which they differentiate to the point of not being able to interbreed. There are two main types of barriers:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Prezygotic barriers</span>: these act before a zygote is even conceived, often preventing mating or successful fertilization if gametes do meet. Examples include geographic isolation, mechanical isolation (it doesn't fit...if you catch my drift), behavioral isolation (mating practices are incompatible), etc.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Postzygotic barriers</span>: these act after conception; they stop the offspring, usually called a hybrid, from producing offspring by making it infertile or not viable.</li>
</ul>
However, there are other ways to define species, like based on physical characteristics (morphological species concept), habitat/ecological niche (ecological species concept), or evolutionary linkage (phylogenic species concept). Furthermore, geographic separation is the primary cause of speciation, but it can happen without this separation. <span style="color: #007fff;">Allopatric speciation</span> consists of a geographic barriers causing a gene flow interruption between two populations. <span style="color: #007fff;">Sympatric speciation</span> is more complicated. It involves no geographic barriers, only reproductive ones. Usually sympatric speciation does not occur with animals, rather with plants or organisms that engage in polyploidy. When it happens in animals, it involves primarily different resource usage within an area.

Well...that too was a large lesson, but thats AP Bio i guess. I hope you're having some fun and this website is helping.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">America Shifts Its Focus Westward</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Manifest Destiny</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The term "<span style="color: #007fff;">manifest destiny"</span>, became commonly used to describe the mission that America had to expand as a nation westward into the rest of the landmass that was adjacent with America, including territory as far west as the Pacific.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Layout of the Land</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Americans were pushing the frontiers of America past the Mississippi and looking to prospectively even settle beyond that, while commercial agriculture thrived in the midwest and industry and manufacturing dominated the Northeast. By 1853, the united States consisted of 48 states, while Hawaii and Alaska were added later to make 50.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mexico</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Independence</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1821, Mexico won independence from Spain, and it settled in Texas. Many American settlers were granted entrance to Texas by the Mexican government as long as all settlers were Roman Catholic and slavery would be banned. American immigrants outnumbered Mexicans greatly in Texas, making immigration closed to any more Americans, causing protest by Moses Austin, the leader of white immigration to Texas, causing him to be jailed.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Dictatorship and Revolt</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Santa Anna</span> became the dictator of Mexico, making the Americans in Texas rebel with violence and causing the <span style="color: #007fff;">battle of the Alamo</span>. Santa Anna couldn't suppress the rebellion, making him sign a treaty that recognized Texas' independence and recognizing it as the Lone Star State, a nation independent from Mexico, Texas, or any other nation at the time. When Texas requested being a state of the U.S. in 1836, the matter was prolonged until 1845 when James K. Polk, a big advocate of territorial expansion, accepted Texas' request for annexation in 1845.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Mexican American War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once accepted as state in the Union, Mexico attacked Texas due to being unsatisfied with the current ownership of disputed lands, making the United States declare war and thus beginning the Mexican War. <span style="color: #007fff;">The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</span> ended the fighting of the Mexican War under the conditions that the United States would recognize the Rio grande as the border between Mexico. Also, the United States had to give Mexico 15 million dollars for the land.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Slavery in Lands Won from Mexico</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the new land made available by the <span style="color: #007fff;">Mexican Cession</span>, David Wilmot proposed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Wilmot Proviso</span> would would prohibit slavery in any new states that were formed from land gained by the cession. John C. Calhoun was an outspoken opponent of the bill, and it was rejected by the Senate under the grounds that it was Congress' duty to protect the land of new settlers, including the slaves of plantation owners.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Desire for the Annexation of California</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before the Mexican War began, Mexico attempted to attract settlers by giving away land in California. Many whites settled in the territory and became absorbed by Spanish culture, but James K. Polk wished for the state to be annexed. He told his request to Mexico and was refused at first, although during the Mexican War, whites started up the <span style="color: #007fff;">Bear Flag Revolt</span>, declaring California and independent territory from mexico, however after the war, the treaty gave California to the U.S as part of the mexican session.In 1849, many settlers flooded to California in hopes of making money by finding large amounts of gold and other precious metals, and also in 1849, California requested statehood upon the condition of having slavery banned in California.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Attempting to Preserve Sectional Balance</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Admitting California as a free state in 1849 would destroy the current balance between free and slave states that was current in 1849. To help relieve the political crisis, Henry Clay proposed<span style="color: #007fff;">  the Compromise of 1850</span>, which would admit California to the American Union as a free state, have popular sovereignty decide the freedom of the rest of the states formed from the Mexican Cession, enforce a Fugitive Slave Law, as well as have Texas give disputed land to the Union to make free states in return for ten million dollars. The Compromise of 1850 was passed by Congress.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Mexican-Americans</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The land that was given to America in the Mexican Cession, particularly New Mexico, contained many Mexicans, making there 75,000 new Mexican immigrants to the United States. Mexicans were discriminated by whites and tension continued between the to groups.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Additional Land Claims and Disputes</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Claims in the Northwest</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Spain gave up its claim in the Oregon Territory in the <span style="color: #007fff;">Adams-Onis Treaty</span>, and Russia withdrew its claims from the territory. Britain eventually set agreed with James K. Polk to set the boundary with the United States at the 49th parallel, due to fear of war with the Americans and their popular cry "<span style="color: #007fff;">Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!</span>" The agreement divided the territory into the Oregon Territory and the Washington Territory.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Cuba</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">President Polk first offered to buy Cuba from Spain, but was refused. Franklin Pierce later secretly sent diplomats to negotiate the purchase of Cuba from Spain. The agreement was known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Ostend Manifesto,</span> and was eventually leaked to the press, forcing Pierce to drop the plan.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Gadsden Purchase</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">America also bought additional land from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase in return for 10 million dollars.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Alaska</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The U.S. also bought land from Russia that was called also, mainly due to the wishes of Secretary of State<span style="color: #007fff;"> William Seward</span>. At first chastised for the decision, Alaska was called Seward's Folly, or Seward"s icebox, until oil and other precious metals were found in the land.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Nixon Administration</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1968</h3>
Richard Nixon was the Republican candidate for the 1968 presidential election, while the democratic candidate was Hubert Humphrey.  There was also a third party candidate, George Wallace, which added great uncertainty to the predicted outcome of the election. Nixon won the election in a very close race.
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Foreign Policy</h3>
Nixon's National Security Advisor, <span style="color: #007fff;">Henry Kissinger</span>, helped Nixon make his mark on foreign policy. Their foreign policy placed a greater significance of using the power of the United States in dealing with other countries, and they also wanted the U.S. to regain the position of power it had in the world after losing some of its influence in dealing with the Soviets and amid their actions.
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Vietnam</h4>
Nixon adopted the idea of <span style="color: #007fff;">Vietnamization</span>, where the U.S. armed and trained the Vietnamese in order to for them to shift some of the military burden toward South Vietnam, so that the U.S. could start bringing some of its troops back home. The U.S. discussed peace with the North while troops were being drawn out by the U.S., when the U.S. bombed North Vietnam in order to seal the deal of negotiating peace. There was an agreement to end the fighting in 1973. By April of 1973, all U.S. troops had left Vietnam for home.
<h4 style="text-align: left;">China</h4>
Nixon came to better relations with communist China by agreeing to interact and cooperate in a manner known as <span style="color: #007fff;">peaceful coexistence</span>. Chinese-American trade was resumed, the U.S. pulled its troops out of Taiwan, and China agreed to recognize Taiwan as part of China.
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Soviet Union</h4>
After easing political tensions with their visit to the Chinese, Nixon and Kissinger used this to their advantage, for such action would force the Soviets to also ease tension with the U.S. in fear of falling behind China. This allowed the U.S. to come to better relations with the Soviets as well; this policy was known as <span style="color: #007fff;">d√©tente</span>. The United States and the Soviets signed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty</span> (SALT I), which agreed to limit the amount of nuclear missiles that both the U.S. and the Soviets produced. The United States also cooperated with Russia with regard to trade and cooperating in research and development.
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domestic Policy</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">New Federalism</h4>
Nixon tried to undo the great shifts of power that went in favor of the central government during Johnson's' administration, and instead he tried to limit big government and give more power back to the states. He did this by <span style="color: #007fff;">revenue sharing</span>, which was basically a method that gave some of the tax money that normally went tot he federal government to the states.
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Judiciary and Supreme Court</h4>
<span style="color: #007fff;">Earl Warren</span>, the Chief Justice of the court who had led a period of judicial activism in the Supreme Court, was replaced by Warren Burger, according to Nixon's wishes, after Warren retired. Burger was a strict constructionist, which was a sharp contrast to the philosophy that led the Court in to the decisions under Warren.
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Watergate Scandal</h3>
In order to find out what the Democrats were up to, the Nixon Administration sent men to break in and plant bugs in the Democratic National Headquarters, which was located in the Watergate hotel. The men were caught, and while interrogating and finding out more on these "burglars", it seemed like some of the information lead back to the Nixon Administration and the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP). Although there was no concrete evidence that undoubtedly proved that Nixon took part in or conducted the scandal, it seemed fairly certain that he was involved. As the case was pursued, it was also found out that Nixon had taped other meeting in the Oval Office, and there was a court hearing. Accusing Nixon of obstructing justice and abusing the power of the presidential office, Nixon was impeached by the House. Nixon admitted that he knew about the coverup, and resigned from office before he was able to be removed. The investigation of the <span style="color: #007fff;">Watergate Scandal</span> led to the discovery of all sorts of Corruption that was taken place during Nixon's Administration. The whole occurrence caused a great amount of unrest and distrust among people toward the American government.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Spiritual Movements and Change</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Second Great Awakening</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the early 19th century, the more relaxed and less serious view of religion that was common during the Enlightenment period was removed by Calvinist religious revivals in a movement known as <span style="color: #007fff;">The Second Great Awakening,</span> renewed Americans' concern for religion. Religious leaders such as Charles G Finney preached sermons that gave hope to Americans, promising them salvation and quelling their fears of damnation by saying they would be saved if they continued to work hard and have strong faith. The area in New York that commonly held sermons was known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Burnt Over District</span>. Peter Cartwright preached Baptist and Methodist views in the south where he attracted thousands of people to hear his lectures on religion.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Philosophy and Transcendentalism</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The idea of transcendentalism became common in the early  1800s. <span style="color: #007fff;">Transcendentalism</span> was a lifestyle and way of thinking that placed a small amount of importance on organized religion and conformity, it instead placed superiority on individualism and being at peace with the world and one's self. Ralph Waldo Emerson was a transcendentalist leader who gave seminars that attracted many people, and he was an opponent of slavery. Henry Thoreau was another well-known transcendentalist who lived by Walden's teachings. he lived in the woods for an experiment, where he reflected on life and attempted to discover truths about the world. Thoreau was an advocate of peaceful protest and only obeying society and laws that agreed with his own morals.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Social and Cultural Movements and Reform</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Brook Farm</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Brook Farm</span> was a social experiment that attracted many philosophers and idealists. The experiment led a lot of free creativity and artistic thinking, however it was all ended due to a high amount of debt and a bad fire that made the Brook Farm project impossible to continue.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Other Communities and Social Projects</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other social utopias and experiment were established by the religious Shakers, as well as in the one Community in New York were all property and people were shared and equal. The Four Phalanxes was another similar project that arranged for people to live together in similar quarters in a community as a way to beat out the fierce competition of society. Robert Owen also formed the secular experiment known as <span style="color: #007fff;">New Harmony</span> which tried close the class and financial gap between people although a financial crisis ended the project.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Changes in Art and Literature</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The painter William Mount and Frederick Church captured the scenic American landscapes in their paintings. Greek architecture also gave a large influence to new buildings that were being built in the early 1800s. Famous novels during the time were the Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Last of the Mohicans by Jane Fenimore Cooper as well as Moby Dick by Herman Melville.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Abstaining from Alcohol</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Temperance, or the refrain from using alcohol, become a widely respected movement  in the 1840s. The Temperance movement made it clear that refraining from alcohol consumption was overall good for society with more effective work on the job, and less crime. Taxes on alcoholic substances were early actions made by states to side with reformers, although as the movement continued and its success became more clear, Maine became the first state to ban the sale of alcohol in 1851.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Reform in Prisons and Mental Institutions</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was a large amount of reform in hospitals, prisons, and schools for the needy in the early 1800s and mid-1800s in an attempt to fix the poor conditions that were evident beforehand. <span style="color: #007fff;">Dorthea Dix</span> was a leading figure in the movement for reforming mental hospitals where  conditions for mentally ill people were initially poor and unsanitary. She convinced states to build new mental hospitals that were more constructive and that had more of a positive environment. Samuel Gridley Howe also contributed to the lives of the physically disabled by founding a school for blind people. Pennsylvania formed new prisons in the state that experimented with locking up convicts in a cell alone to give them space to reflect on their life and actions, although it proved to be a failure because of the high amount of suicides that the confinement caused.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">A Brighter future for Public Education</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the largest leaders for public school reform was <span style="color: #007fff;">Horace Mann</span> who worked to improve school conditions by making attendance mandatory, making the school year longer, and by increasing advocating an increase in the skill of teachers. Tax-supported schools became common among states. Horace Mann and other teacher made textbooks the main resource for education as well a guide for the way to act and the formation for one's work ethic in order to obtain success in one's career. The Second Great Awakening also encouraged the establishment of new colleges.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Differences in the Family and Genders</h3>
After the industrial revolution, the typical American family was being redefined and so were the roles of men and women. As the years rolled on toward the mid 1800s, the average size of an American family decreased to about five or six members. Most women that were wives in middle class families tended to take care of the home while the husband went to work. <span style="color: #007fff;">The Cult of Domesticity</span>, which many such women abided, basically stated the idea that women and men were leaders in their own spheres, were the woman's sphere was at the home and man's sphere was at work or in other worldly matters.
<h3 style="text-align: left;"> The Advancement Toward Women's Rights</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Grimke sisters were leaders in the women's movement and were advocates for the complete equality between men and women.Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Candy Stanton also started campaigning for women's rights reform. The leaders of the women's rights movement held a convention known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Seneca Falls Convention</span> in 1848 where they discussed the necessity of equality between genders and the discrimination that currently existed.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Abolitionism and Antislavery</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Especially after the Antislavery movement, people began to more openly express their opposition to slavery. <span style="color: #007fff;">William Lloyd Garrison</span>, a radical abolitionist, demanded the immediate freedom of all slaves, and even held contempt for the Constitution in the way that it was a "pro-slavery" document. He started an abolitionist newspaper that was known as The Liberator. Garrison's extreme wishes and beliefs caused the abolitionist movement to split, with one section forming a political party known as the liberty party, who ran James Birney as their candidate in 1840. Escaped and free blacks were also outspoken abolitionists, such as <span style="color: #007fff;">Frederick Douglass</span>. Other blacks that opposed slavery included Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth, and they helped slaves reach freedom through a system known as the underground railroad. In the south, a slave named Nat Turner led a violent revolt among slaves where over 50 whites were killed, and in punishment the revolt was crushed and many blacks were killed. The violent incident put and end to antislavery murmurs that were taking place in the south earlier.</p>

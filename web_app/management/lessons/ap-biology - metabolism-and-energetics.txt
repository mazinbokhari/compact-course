<span style="color: #007fff;">Metabolism</span> is defined as all the chemical processes in an organism and the energy expended to carry on these processes. Again, on the AP it isn't necessary that one know the nitty-gritty details of this subject, only the base level knowledge of terminology is needed.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Metabolic Pathways</span></h2>
A pathway is the steps taken for a process to occur and turn a reactant into a product. As we will soon discuss, enzymes play a role in a majority of these steps by enhancing their spontaneity. There are two types of pathways: <span style="color: #007fff;">anabolic</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">catabolic</span>. An anabolic pathway involves the build up of smaller molecules into bigger ones through the use of energy; catabolic pathways are the opposite, the involve the breakdown of complex molecules and the release of energy in the process.

<img class="aligncenter" alt="\bigtriangleup G = \bigtriangleup H - T\bigtriangleup S" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bigtriangleup&amp;space;G&amp;space;=&amp;space;\bigtriangleup&amp;space;H&amp;space;-&amp;space;T\bigtriangleup&amp;space;S" align="absmiddle" />

The equation above is called Gibbs Free Energy Equation. It sums up everything one needs to knwo about energy and if a reaction will proceed on its own or not. The G stands for "free energy"; the H for "enthalpy" (the difference in energy bewtween the reactants and products) ; the T for temperature; the S for entropy (disorder within a system), For the AP, you might need to know how to just plug in numbers for the grid-in section, but not much more than that.

With this equation, one must note, a negative delta-G shows a reactions can proceed on its own, while a positive shows it cannot proceed without energy input.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Exergonic vs Endergonic reactions</span></h2>
The difference between these two types of reactions is crucial information for the free response section. <span style="color: #007fff;">Exergonic</span> reactions release energy and often occur spontaneously; <span style="color: #007fff;">endergonic</span> reactions require energy input and absorb said energy. Thus exergonic has a negative gibbs free energy quantity, while endergonic has a positive gibbs free energy.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">ATP: the Metabolic Fuel</span></h2>
ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is the most commonly used fuel source for harnessing metabolic energy in organisms. The molecule consists of an adenine nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar, and three phosphates. The phosphate section is where ATP gets its functionality. These phosphates are attached by very unstable, high energy bonds. When broken, these bonds release energy that can be used for metabolic work. The breaking of ATP is called <span style="color: #007fff;">dephosphorylation</span>, while the formation is called <span style="color: #007fff;">phosphorylation. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, ATP is ususally regenerated through cellular respiration. </span>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Enzymes</span></h2>
Most of the free energy our body makes available wouldn't be present without the work of enzymes. <span style="color: #007fff;">Enzymes</span> are molecules that speed up, or catalyze, a reaction by reducing the energy input required for the reaction to proceed. This energy input is known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">activation energy</span>. Without enzymes in our bodies, we wouldn't be able to function because the activation energy for most of our bodily processes would not be met.

Enzymes lower activation energy in a couple of ways. Almost all enzymes work with one or multiple specific molecules/reactants called <span style="color: #007fff;">substrates</span>. An enzyme will usually join to a substrate to form a enzyme-substrate complex. A substrate usually fits into the <span style="color: #007fff;">active site</span> of an enzyme when it forms this complex. Often times, this active site will have certain side chain/R-groups to facilitate a reaction of the substrate or will put the substrates in such close proximity to each other, the likelihood that the substrates react will increase.

Thus, an enzyme will increase the rate of a reaction using its active site. IF one increases the substrate concentration, the reaction rate will level off with respect to time, since the enzymes will become saturated. At this point, only adding more enzyme will affect the reaction rate.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Inhibitors, Feedback, Location...oh my</span></h2>
There remains only a couple things left to talk about with enzymes.

Enzyme <span style="color: #007fff;">inhibitors</span> are molecules that disrupt the ability of the enzyme to catalyze a reaction. Inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive. <span style="color: #007fff;">Competitive inhibitors</span> actively compete with the substrate to get into the active site and are similar enough to the substrate to fit. <span style="color: #007fff;">Noncompetitive inhibitors</span> do not inhibit from the active site, but rather attach to the enzyme at another location and change the shape of the enzyme and active site, ruining its catabolic abilities.

Enzymes frequently work within pathways to produce intermediate and final products. In organisms, <span style="color: #007fff;">feedback regulation</span> controls to what extent certain product are produced for efficiency's sake. ***This is a huge topic on the AP. Feedback refers to a pathway regulating the continuation itself through production of temporary enzyme inhibitors. <span style="color: #007fff;">Negative feedback</span> is when a pathway will slow itself down; <span style="color: #007fff;">Positive feedback</span> involves a pathway speeding itself up and continuing itself. For example, a four step process may produce a end product that inhibits the second step's enzyme from functioning correctly.

Finally, location...the function of an enzyme will greatly affect its location withing an organism. This compliments enzymes extreme specificity of substrates for enzymes will proportionally be used where their function is needed.

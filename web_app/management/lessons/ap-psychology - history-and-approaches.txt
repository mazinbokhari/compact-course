<h2 style="text-align: center;">History of Psychology</h2>
<h3>Introspection-Structuralism:</h3>
Early philosophers like Plato and Democritis thought about the relationship between the brain and behavior but not until 1879 had there been any physical progression. In 1879, <span style="color: #3366ff;">Wilhelm Wundt </span>created the first physcological lab that allowed him to train people in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">introspection</span> which is seeing how people respond cognitively to stimuli. He focused on the makeup of the mind and the identification of feelings, perception, and images. Through his lab work, Wundt came up with his theory of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">structuralism</span>. Structuralism is the thought that the mind functions through the emotions and sensations. From wundt came many other strucutral psychologists like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">G. Stanley hall</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Edward Titchener</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and Margaret Floy Washburn.</span> G. Stanley Hall created his own lab like Wundt but his was at John Hopkins University. Along with starting his own lab, hall helped found the American Psychological association and became its first president. Titchener brought the idea of introspection into his own lab where he looked at how the basic elements of the brain were related. Washburn was the first woman to received her ph.D in psychology. These psychologists were all from the School of Stucturalism.
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Introspection- Functionalism:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">William James believed that structuralists werent looking at the brain correctly. He wanted to figure out the purpose or the function that brain had in the behavior of humans. He thought that humans were more likely to be involved subjectively in understanding their actions and feeling than objectively. Other functional psychologists, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">James Cattell</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">John Dewey,</span> focused on the mental functions of the brain and how that influenced behavior. James Cattell is known for mental testing which John Dewey is know for child development and education. Along with Mary Whiton Calkins, who became the first woman president of the American Psychological Association, these psychologists make up the School of Functionalism.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Psychological Approaches</h2>
<h3>Behavioral Approach:</h3>
Behaviorists believe that behavior results from learning and conditionaing. They focus on measuring observable behavior that happens because of the enviornment they are in. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ivan Pavlov</span> was one of the first behaviorists and he trained dogs to salivate when a tone was heard. He learned about conditioning and stimulus-response learning. Behaviorists analyze the enviornment around the subject before the behavior occurs, the actual behavior itself, and the repercussions after the behavior or also know as stimuli and response. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">John B. Watson</span> believed that to make psychology a science they would have to study observable traits like behavior and not just unobservable traits like the unconscious responses. B.F. Skinner expanded on the idea of behaviorism and showed that behavior can be encouraged by positive reinforcements or discouraged by negative reinforcements. He used birds and treats to show how positive and negative reinforcement work. Behavioral psychology was the main psychological perspective from the 1920s to the 1960s.
<h3>Humanistic Approach:</h3>
Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers believed in free will and the ability to solve their own problems. Humanists believed that behavior and choices are dependent on physiological, emotional, or spiritual needs. Although humanisitc theories arent easily tested by scientific method, many psychologists use these ideas to help patients out in solving problems in their everyday life.
<h3>Psychoanalytic Approach:</h3>
Sigmund Freud treated patients for mental diseases by talking to them over long periods of time to uncover the unconscious mind which included conflicts, motives, and defenses which strengthened the patient's self knowledge. Freud believed that repression was a main cause of mental disorders because anger and tension have been built up for many years which cause the body harm. Through word association, dream analysis, and other psychological therapies, a psychoanalytic psychologist would further understand the human thought and behavior of a patient.
<h3>Biological Approach:</h3>
Biological psychologists think that what the mind does and how a person acts is through the biological makeup of the person. A person may act or think based on their genes, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The behavior or organisms may be caused by the chemical and biological processes that occur in the body.
<h3>Evolutionary Approach:</h3>
Bases on Charles Darwin's idea of natural selection is a main theory in evolutionary psychology because psychologists believe that behavior is caused by the adaptations of organisms to survive in the enviornment around them. The traits that are more advantageous to the a person have a higher rate of survival and will be the traits passed down from generation to generation.
<h3>Cognitive Approach:</h3>
Cognitive psychologists emphasize how people handle, remember, and store social situations. This is because the different ways people look at situations and how they view the world will impact how they behave and think in different enviornments.Jean Piaget is a cognitive psychologist that studied cognitive development of children.
<h3>Sociocultural Approach:</h3>
People from different cultures have different social norms and experiene situations differently. Psychologists analyzie the differences between people from different cultures by studying gestures, spoken language and body language. This approach attempts to understand the differences ion cultures and try tp predict how a person would act in different enviornments.

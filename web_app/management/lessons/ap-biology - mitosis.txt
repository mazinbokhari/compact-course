The whole process of cell creation and division is known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">cell cycle</span>. Cell division within the cell cycle produces identical daughter cells to the original parent cells. On the AP exam, the cell cycle is covered more in the multiple choice and less on the free response. Another thing to note, <em>its no longer necessary to know the detailed steps of the cell division or mitosis</em>. Before we dive into the processes of the cell cycle, lets look at the variables involved in these processes
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Genetic Material within Eukaryotic cells</span></h2>
Eukaryotic cells have DNA within their nuclei. The unit of replication for DNA is a chromosome, which is just tightly coiled DNA to prevent breakages while replicating. In somatic, or body cells, this genetic material comes in copied pairs and thus these cells can be called <span style="color: #007fff;">diploid</span>. <span style="color: #007fff;">Haploid</span> cells are those that contain only one copy of the total number of chromosomes; usually reproductive cells like eggs and sperm (LOL) will be haploid. In humans, diploid cells have 46 chromosomes (two sets of 23) and haploid cells have 23 chromosomes.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">An Overview of Cell Division</span></h2>
Cell division is always begins with preceded by copying of the DNA and then coiling of the DNA into chromosomes. Each chromosome has a copy called a <span style="color: #007fff;">sister chromatid</span>. The two sister chromatids are attached initially in the middle by cohesion proteins most closely at the <span style="color: #007fff;">centromere</span>. During Mitosis, the chromosome pairs line up in the middle of the parent cell and then are pulled apart from the centromere by mitotic spindles which arise from a small organelle called centrioles. Once these have been pulled to two opposite ends of the cell, nucleuses begin reforming around the two new sets of chromosomes. Then the cytoplasm divides in a process called <span style="color: #007fff;">cytokinesis</span>. Thus, two new daughter cells are born!
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Cell Cycle Phases</span></h2>
There are several phases of the cell cycle. The two big sections of the cell cycle are <span style="color: #007fff;">mitosis</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">interphase</span>. A cell spends about 90% of its time in interphase; this is where the cell grows and readies itself for cell division. Interphase is broken into three sub-phases: G1 phase, S phase, G2 phase. The G1 and G2 phases involve growth of the cell in preparation for cell division, while S phase consists of the cell copying DNA and synthesizing chromosomes. Normal development of an eukaryotic cell and ekaryotic organisms depend on a normal, steady progression through these phases and correctly timed mitosis.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Controlling the Cell Cycle</span></h2>
The progression of the cell cycle is dependent on a series of cell signals and passing through <span style="color: #007fff;">checkpoints</span>. Chemical signals from cyclically functioning molecules help the cell cycle progress through its three main checkpoints in G1, G2, and M phase (Mitosis phase). *** If a cell never receives a signal to proceed at G1 phase, it exits the cell cycle and enters G0 phase where it does not divide. This frequently happens with mature cardiac muscle cells and nervous cells.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Cancer cells vs Normal cells</span></h2>
There are some very distinct differences between cells that progress normally through the cell cycle and cancer cells which exit and multiply rapidly in no regular cycle. Two characteristics of normal cells include <span style="color: #007fff;">density dependent inhibition</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">anchorage dependence</span>. Density dependent inhibition consists of the binding of surface proteins on adjacent proteins which sends signals inhibiting further cell division. If there's no space to divide, normal cells will stop dividing. Anchorage dependence is the characteristic of having to be attached to some sort of extracellular matrix or some other layer of tissue. Cancer cells don't exhibit these two characteristics and don't rely on growth factors (chemicals that trigger growth within cells) to divide. They don't follow normal cell cycle checkpoint control and may divide indefinitely. If a cell <span style="color: #007fff;">transforms</span> into a cancer cell, the immune system may destroy it, but if it proliferates it may become a tumor. The key to unlocking the cure to cancer is heavily dependent on making the cell cycle and its control system insanely precise even with age.

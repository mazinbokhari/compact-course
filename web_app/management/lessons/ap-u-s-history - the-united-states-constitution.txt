<h2 style="text-align: center;">Addressing Weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation</h2>
The Articles granted very little power to the central government, and it did not give the government the  ability to collect taxes, for the government could only borrow money from the states. This caused the new nation of America to go into an economic depression. The document gave government only one branch of Congress, and the process of amending the Articles made the task nearly impossible.
<h3>The Annapolis Convention</h3>
At the Annapolis Convention in 1785, it was agreed to revise the Articles in an attempt to fix some of the problems it posed for the new nation and its overly weak government at another convention. That convention was held in Philadelphia with over fifty delegates present, and it was decided that a new document was needed to frame the government properly.
<h3>The Philadelphia Convention</h3>
Although the initial intention for the Philadelphia Convention was just to revise the Articles of Confederation in Philadelphia, the delegates soon realized a new document was necessary. The meetings to create this new constitution were held secretly and secluded from the public in Philadelphia with George Washington as chairperson.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Critical Topics During the Drafting of the Constitution</h2>
<h3> Representation</h3>
The delegates from different states disagreed on the method to decide the amount of representation each state would receive in Congress. The debate mainly circled two main ideas: the <span style="color: #007fff;">New Jersey Plan</span> and the <span style="color: #007fff;">Virginia Plan</span>.
<h3>The New Jersey Plan</h3>
Favored by smaller states, it proposed the idea of giving all states an equal amount of state representatives in Congress.
<h3>The Virginia Plan</h3>
Favored by larger states, it proposed the idea of giving states an a number of state representatives in Congress that would be proportional to the population of the state with a higher state population assigning a higher number of representatives.
<h3>The Great Compromise</h3>
This idea for representation was a combination of the two previously mentioned plans for representation. It would establish a bicameral legislature, with one house of Congress granted equal represenation with the other house granting state representation based on population
<h3>Three Fifths Compromise</h3>
It was decided that when determining a state's population in order to grant a state the appropriate number of representatives, all slaves would only count as 3/5 of a person.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> The Ratification and Acceptance of the Constitution</h2>
The Constitution was ratified in 1790, and Rhode Island was ninth state to ratify in order to put the document under effect with the necessary approval from 9 out of 13 states. The The ratification was technically illegal because it ignored the rules of the Articles, the supreme law of the land at the time.
<h3>Federalists</h3>
James Madison, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton,  and others supporters of the Constitution, most typically merchants,  were known as the Federalists: they wanted the constitution to grant the central more power than it was previously given by the Articles of Confederation.
<h3>THE FEDERALIST PAPERS</h3>
James Madison, who was also referred to as the "Father of the Constitution" lead the writing of 85 persuasive essays to convince the necessity of ratifying the new constitution.
<h3>Anti-federalists</h3>
Patrick Henry, John Hancock, and other people that opposed the constitution were the Anti-Federalists. They feared that power the Constitution granted the central government would allow a reutrn of the tyranny that the colonists experienced under the rule of Britain. They were concerned with the states rights, and they felt a Bill of Rights in the Constitution would be necessary. Anti-federalists mainly consisted of farmers rather than merchants.
<h3>Bill of Rights</h3>
After the raitification of the Constitution, the heated debate regarding whether or not to add a Bill of Rights in order to protect the rights of individuals continued, with Anti-Federalists strongly in favor. There were reasons that made it seem like a Bill of Rights wasn't even necessary, for all state constitutions had a Bill of Rights included, and there were also certain rights listed in the Articles of the actual constitution. A bill of Rights was finally added in 1791 and were the first ten amendments.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Makeup</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Key Concepts of Government implemented the Constitution</h2>
<h3>Three Branches of Government and Checks and Balances</h3>
The legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government were established in an effort to spread out the power of government, so that one official or branch of government wouldn't become too powerful, and since each branch's power was kept in check by the power of the others, there was less of a chance for corruption to occur.
<h3>Federalism and Limited Government</h3>
In a similar fashion that the three ranches of government checked each other's powers, there was also a balance of power between the central government and the states. The idea of there being such a distribution in power is known as federalism and is a key principle that the United States Constitution was founded on.

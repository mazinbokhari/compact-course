<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Progressive Movement and Issues in the Economy</h1>
The progressive movement began as an idea in the early 1900s that evolved into a party. The progressives were strong advocates for change, which they wanted to be made possible by the government. The progressives battled unfair cutthroat competition in business as well as corruption in politics. Journalists who helped expose the corruption and bad practices to help progressives in their effort to take down such problems in politics in the economy were known as <span style="color: #007fff;">muckrakers</span>. Famous muckrakers and their works to expose corruption and poor conditions in the economy are listed below

•Upton Sinclar : He revealed the poor and terribly unsanitary conditions of the meat packing plants in his book "<span style="color: #007fff;">The Jungle</span>".

•Ida Tarbell: She exposed the brutal tactics used by John Rockefeller in an article "History of the Standard Oil Company".

•Lincoln Steffens: He wrote "<em>Shame of the Cities"</em>
<h2>Accomplishments of the Progressive Party</h2>
The Party's accomplishments entail reform in the Voting Process including a more democratic process, with more direct primaries, and the direct election of senators instead of having state legislatures vote for the senators. Prohibition of alcohol, which was established in the 18th amendment, was initiated by the progressives, as well as an increase in women's rights and eventually women's suffrage, or women earning the right to vote, which was gained in the 19th amendment. Other achievements made by the progressive party included a graduated income tax, which gave higher tax rates to those with a higher income, safer and more sanitary conditions in the workplace, regulation of big business and industry, and an increase in the amount of conservation project to help protect the environment.
<h2>Labor Unions</h2>
The <span style="color: #007fff;">Industrial Workers of the World</span>, known as the Wobblies, were labor union lead by Eugene V. Debs who was arrested for his involvement in the Pullman Strike, and they believed in talking and negotiating through the system for better conditions.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">African Americans</h1>
<h2>Demographic Changes</h2>
The <span style="color: #007fff;">Great Migration</span> was the movement of blacks going North and leaving the South for better employment opportunities and  less fear of segregation and violence which began around 1910. During this time, organizations such as the NAACP, or the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the National Urban League, and the Nation of Islam were developed in order to help accommodate the new blacks in the north.
<h2>Major African American Leaders</h2>
•<span style="color: #007fff;">Booker T Washington</span>: Born a slave, and he encouraged blacks to work hard in order to obtain eventual economic equality, although he did not expect or believe blacks would have equal social standing to whites.

•<span style="color: #007fff;">Du Bois</span>: He was not born a slave. but rather free born, and he founded the NAACP and thought blacks shoo;d strive to attain total equality.

•Marcus Garvey : He was from America and his leadership was widely supported ordinary African Americans.
<h2>Roosevelt's Regulation of Business of and Land</h2>
Theodore Roosevelt gained the title of "<span style="color: #007fff;">Trustbuster</span>", for the way he strictly enforced the Sherman Antitrust Act and brought over forty lawsuits to collaboration of businesses that were along the lines of violating the act. Under his administration, Congress also passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, as well as th Elkins and HepBurn Act which fortified the Interstate Commerce Commission. Roosevelt was also a powerful leader in the conservation movement, especially when he canceled the sale of 200 million acres of public land and established the Inland Waterways Commission.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Taft Administration and Domestic Economics</h1>
The Dingley Tariff of 1897 was still under effect during Taft's presidency, and Republicans normally supported high tariffs, although more and more high tariffs were being blamed for the increase in prices. Taft said he would reduce tariffs, so he signed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff because it lowered certain rates, althought it raised many others. He signed it mainly to get other legislation passed that he wanted to be passed.
<h2>The Republican Party Splits</h2>
The split in the Republican Party and the formation of the progressive party was linked to Richard Ballinger, an official under Taft who reopnened the sales for certain land that Roosevelt previously closed. He was muckraked by a forester for certain corrupt activity, although Ballinger was found to be innocent of these. The forester, Pinchot, was then fired by Taft, angering progresives and causing the split of the Republican party in the Porgressive Party.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Election of 1912</h1>
The Progressive Party, also known ad the <span style="color: #007fff;">Bull-Moose Party</span>, elected Theodore Roosevelt, who ran against the Republican candidate Taft and the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson. Due to the split of the Republican Party, Wilson won the election of 1912 and became the next president of the United States.
<h1>The Wilson Administration</h1>
<h2>Tariffs</h2>
Under Wilson, a new lower tariff known as the Underwood-Simmons tariff of 1913 was passed despite a locked debate in the Senate.
<h2>The Regulation of Banks</h2>
Also during the Woodrow Wilson Administration, Congress established the Aldrich Commission to keep an eye on the flow and amount of money because of the Panic of 1907 that foreclosed banks. The Commission stated that there were numerous reasons for reform in the banking system, and in response, Wilson enacted the<span style="color: #007fff;"> Federal Reserve Act</span> that would enable banks to be more flexible with their money and be able to receive temporary money during a crisis. The Act also set up the Federal Reserve Bank that would be run by a "Board of Governors".
<h2>The Regulation of Business</h2>
Wilson also made efforts to regulate big business through passing the Clayton Antitrust Act as well as his creation of the Federal Trade Commission. This allowed for the investigation of business for illegal practices as well as the ability for the government to dissolve businesses that were convicted of poor and unmoral marketing practices.

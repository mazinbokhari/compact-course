The background one comes from has a profound effect on how he or she will vote. The following generate many questions on the AP exam.
<h3>Income</h3>
People with higher incomes are more likely to vote. Additionally, people with higher incomes are generally more likely to vote for a Republican candidate.
<h3>Education</h3>
People with more education are more likely to vote. Additionally, people with more education are likely to vote for a Republican candidate. Although, education seemed to be less of a factor in the 2008 and 2012 elections.
<h3>Ethnicity</h3>
Whites have higher turnout rates than do blacks and other minorities such as Hispanics. However, blacks with the same education and income level as whites vote in higher percentages. Blacks largely vote for Democratic candidates.
<h3>Gender</h3>
Men vote at a lower rate than do women. Men prefer Republican candidates, while women tend to support Democrats.
<h3>Age</h3>
Young people vote at lower percentages than older people. Young people tend to prefer Democrats, while older people tend to support Republicans.
<h3>Religion</h3>
Protestants are known for supporting Republicans candidates. In fact, people use a term for these devout conservatives: WASPs - White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Low Voter Turnout</h2>
In general, there are several features of the American voting system that results in low voter turnout than most other democratic countries.
<h3>Voter Fatigue</h3>
Because of the United States' federal system (rather than a unitary of confederate system), there are many elected government positions, ranging from local to state to national levels. Thus, America has many more elections than other democratic countries have. There are so many elections that it is difficult for most to participate in each one they are eligible for. In fact, the majority of Americans only vote in the presidential elections and completely ignore all the other ones like the primaries and state and local elections.
<h3>Decline of Political Efficacy</h3>
As we already learned, Americans think that they have little impact on the government and the decision it makes, which is why many choose not to even bother voting.
<h3>Difficult Voter Registration</h3>
The process of registering to vote in the United States is not easy due to many registration laws set in place to stop voting fraud. Many citizens do not want to go through the pain of registering, which leaves them unable to cast a vote in any election. The simple fact that many democratic countries automatically register citizens to vote leaves people wondering why the process in America is so difficult. The Motor Voter Act has made registration easier by enabling people to register to vote while renewing their drivers' license. Nevertheless, many people do not drive cars, leaving them out of the benefits of the bill. Furthermore, the bill actually created a disproportion in the increase of voter registration, as much of the people who do not drive cars are living in poverty.
<h3>Weekday Presidential Election</h3>
Every four years, the presidential election is held on a Tuesday, so many people feel inconvenienced by having to vote on the same day they have work.
<h3>Cross-Pressures</h3>
Voters who belong to conflicting groups that determine their voting behavior are said to have cross-pressures. For example, a young white male has cross-pressure because young people tend to vote for Democrats, but whites and men tend to vote for Republicans. People facing cross-pressures are less likely to vote.

<p style="text-align: left;">The saying of the 1920s, mainly under the administration of Harding who won the presidency in 1920, was "return to normalcy", which could also be described by the return to laissez-faire capitalism. Laissez faire was promoted during this time period by passing a tariff, loaning money to government in return for the sales of U.S. goods, and being tougher and more strict with labor unions and strikes. During this time while big business was on the rise while rights for the labor force starting to decline, boycotts were made illegal and also the minimum wage for women was removed.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Trouble for Farmers</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The cut in loans to Allies as well as higher tariffs made farmers suffer an economic blow in the 1920s, although earlier on in the decade they also benefited and prospered. Surpluses also had an impact on farmers, although Congress established the Farm Board in order to buy such surpluses from the farmers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Corruption in Business and Government</h3>

After the great migration, there were some areas in cities that were almost entirely populated by blacks, such as Harlem, which was the main site of the black cultural and artistic movement known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Harlem Renaissance</span>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Prohibition and its End</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">18th amendment</span> which enacted prohibited was a difficult law to enforce because many Americans disagreed with the law and found ways to get around it through smuggling systems such as bootlegging, which was a term used to describe the underground trafficking of alcohol during the time that it was . Congress the Volstead Act, which would have enforced the 18th amendment. The amendment and Prohibition was repealed by the <span style="color: #007fff;">21st amendment</span> in 1933.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Immigration</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">After world war 1, legislation was passed to restrict immigration starting with the Immigration Restriction Act in 1921 and the National Origins Act in 1924. The laws were passed with the purpose of lowering the amount of immigrants from Asia and southern Europe.</p>

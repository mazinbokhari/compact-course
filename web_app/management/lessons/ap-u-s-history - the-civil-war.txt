<h2 style="text-align: center;">Preparing and Strategizing for War</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Northern War Advantages</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">•A larger army and population</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Had better skilled officers</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•A superior railroad system</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Had much more industry and factories for manufacturing war goods</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•An established and powerful central government</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Southern War Advantages</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Was fighting a defensive war</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Received finances from overseas cotton purchases</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Organizing Troops for War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both the North and South resorted to draft laws in order to get soldiers. The draft applied to all men as old a 17, and there were certain exemption laws and substitues were allowed, and in the North, a draftee could be exmepted by paying a fine. Such policies caused poorer families to become upset and begin Draft Riots. When the amount of battle ready men started to dwindle, the North allowed blacks to serve in 1862.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">African Americans Fighting in the War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was discrimination in the military; blacks were rarely soldiers and were more often cooks, drivers, and medics. The Confiscation Act of 1861 stated that any slaves who escaped to the Union would gain their freedom. Slaves did not fight in the south, but they did take on war construction related projects and indirectly help with the war effort.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Financing the War</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The North</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Selling government bonds</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Higher Tariffs</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Issuing and using paper money</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The South</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Land taxes</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Taxes on specific goods</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Issuing more paper money</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">A New Confederate Nation</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Confederate Constitution</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Following Provisions were established under the Confederate Constitution</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Protective tariffs were banned</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•All property including slaves were protected</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•States rights were superior to the central government</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Retaliation From States Within the Confederacy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">North Carolina did not obey the draft law, and South Carolina and Georgia even talked of secession from the Confederacy.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Support of Western Europe</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">France and Britain sympathized with the Confederacy and they believed being allies with them would provide them with a steady source of cotton for their textile mills.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Women And the War Effort</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Women on both sides adapted to help with the war effort in their own way. They took the place of the the men in the manufacturing and factory jobs, however there wages were less than what men were paid. Women raised money for the war as well as sewed and did medic type jobs. Women were also spies, and some fought as soldiers while disguised as men.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Northern Battle Plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Capture the capitol of the Confederate States of America (C.S.A.), Richmond</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Block southern ports and trade</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Control the Mississippi River</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•The main goal was to split the south and block their port so they couldn't trade their cotton with foreign nations in exchange for supplies; without imports the South would be nearly entirely starved of its much needed manufactured goods.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Fighting Begins</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The First Battle of Bull Run</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In what was the first actual battle of the Civil War, 30,00 Union troops went down to Bull Run Creek, Virginia in 1861. The Union was winning the battle at first, but then were counterattacked by <span style="color: #007fff;">General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson</span> and were forced to retreat. The battle ended any kind of hopes for their to be a quick war.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Antietam</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lee continued with his force after winning in the clash at the Second Battle of Bull Run in northern Virginia and planned to attack at Maryland where he hoped to win a key victory in order to officially win the support of Britain. General McClellan of the Union army knew Lee's battle plan because it had been dropped by a Confederate officer, although the battle of Antietam ensued in 1861 and proved to be the bloodiest day of the war with over 20,000 men being either killed or wounded. Lee's forces were pushed back and forced to retreat to Virginia.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Vicksburg</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The North lost a key battle at Chancellorsville, and after the battle southern general Robert E. Lee was able to take his troops northward. He hoped to end the war quickly by going on the offensive, but he was defeated and forced to retreat at Gettysburg. General Ulysses S Grant secured the Mississippi by raiding Vicksburg in 1863, which was on the Mississippi.  The Northern victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg proved to be the beginning of the North having the upper hand in the war, with the South entering more and more of a state of economic depression and overall desperation. Next year, Grant was in control of the entire Union army.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Union Blockade</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the war, the Northern strategy of cutting off the south's ports and trade proved to be very effective. It was an important reason as to why the South became incredibly desperate for war goods and supplies in the final years of the war.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">General Sherman's "March From the Sea"</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Grant and Lee engaged their armies in a series of battles, when finally Grant surrounded Lee at Richmond. General William Sherman led his army in a "march from the sea" from Atlanta, which he burned, to Savannah. Sherman's forces brutally destroyed all in their path, demonstrating total war in order to completely obliterate any of the Confederates' hopes in the war and crush their will of fighting on. His march lasted from 1864-1865.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Fall of Richmond and the End of the War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Grant continued to attack and contain Lee at Petersburg. Shortly after, Richmond fell, and Lee surrendered, marking the end of the War in 1865.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lincoln's Presidency During the War</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Emancipation Proclamation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite Lincoln's hesitance to abolish slavery altogether due to political reasons and fear of prejudice, Lincoln issued the <span style="color: #007fff;">Emancipation Proclamation</span> in 1862, which freed all slaves in rebelling states. The document did not grant freedom to slaves in border states, although Lincoln did encourage those states to develop a plan that would emanciapte their slaves with compensation to the slaves' owners. The Emancipation Proclamation did not technically grant freedom, because it only applied to slaves in Confederate states that were not under Union control; although the document gave a new meaning to the entire war. Lincoln was mainly attmpting to end the war through pressurring the Confederates states to come to peace as early as possible.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1864</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Democrats and republicans joined to form the Union party in the North for the election of 1864, and they nominated Lincoln as their candidate and Andrew Johnson as Vice President. With the war being won with the nation staying organized and under control, with banking being stronger than ever, it seemed clear that Lincoln would be reelected when running agins the Democratic candidate and war-hero General George McClellan. Lincoln won reelection in 1864 by a landslide without surprise.</p>

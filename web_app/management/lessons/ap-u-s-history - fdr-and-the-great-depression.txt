<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Hoover Administration</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the Hoover Administration, there were significant weaknesses in the American economy. Some reasons that contributed to these weaknesses were the large surpluses of farmer's crops, many people buying stock on margin, and also tax policies that created large wealth and class gaps. The crisis was also because of poorly managed and unsuccGessful banks as well as well as high tariffs that lowered the amount of foreign business that the U.S. was involved. A large amount of the U.S. population was also buying on credit, and at a point it had bought so much on credit that there people almost had all of what they wanted, which served as another crucial catalyst for an economic depression due to unbalanced levels of supply and demand.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Stock Market Crash of 1929</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since so many stocks were bought on margin, the stocks were way overvalued, and some insiders that knew this began to sell, and eventually everybody began selling which caused the ultimate crash which occurred on a date known as <span style="color: #007fff;">Black Tuesday</span>. After the crash, many people who had money invested in stocks lost a lot of money, their jobs, and homes. Since people could not pay back their loans to banks, banks were forced to foreclose and go under.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Hoover's Method on Dealing with the Depression</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Home Loan Bank Act and Reconstruction Finance Corporation were passed in order to help businesses regain footing. Hoover thought the depression would be short, although he did not believe that it was the responsibility or that it was the best idea for the government to directly help the unemployed and Americans through and the depression, but rather that it was the role of the community to help each other and rise up as one. He believed that this attitude would eventually get America out of the depression. Hoover did order the Farm Board to help out farmers and keep the prices of their crops up by buying their surpluses, however the surpluses kept adding up so the board eventually stopped buying their crop surpluses.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Bonus Army</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">bonus army</span> was a group of about 20,00 military veterans who demanded their compensation bonuses that were initially scheduled to be payed to them later marched on Washington D.C. The marchers set up a shanty camp, known as a "Hooverville" by D.C.,  and after the bill was rejected by Congress many of the veterans left, while some other stayed until they were violently and aggressively dispatched by the military force that Hoover ordered.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The FDR Administration</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The 1932 Election</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In one of the most intense times of the Great Depression, the disapproval for the Republican Hoover ran high, which allowed Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the democratic candidate, to win the election.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt's Plan and the New Deal</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt promised three parts of change that would ultimately lead to the improvement of economic conditions which were simplified down to relief, recovery, and reform. After taking office in 1933, the following hundred days were a period that entailed Congress passing every single law or policy that Roosevelt wished to put into effect, giving that time period the name "<span style="color: #007fff;">The One-Hundred Days</span>".</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Fireside Chats: Roosevelt spoke directly to the American people in a series of these talks to advise and help them through the depression by letting them know what must be done.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">•The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA): It hired poor people in the Tennessee Valley area to build dams, manufacture fertilizer, and control flooding and erosion.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Regulation of Agricultural Output</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) payed farmers subsidies to reduce the amount of land they plowed to encourage growing less crops and raise prices.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">FUrther Recovery in the Industry and economy</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">•NRA: The National Recovery Administration helped businesses become profitable again by setting up a plan that would outline the functions of the businesses such as the amount of labor, labor hours, and level of production.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•CWA: The Civil Works Administration also hired people to work on temporary construction projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•SEC: The Securities Exchange Commission was made to keep watch over the stock market in order to ensure that certain occurrences that led to the stock market crash did not happen again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•FHA: Gave bank loans to people who would buy new houses as well as renovate or fix old houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•WPA: The WPA, or Works Progress Administration, also spent a lot of money in order to help people get jobs. These people also worked on construction projects as a source of work.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Second New Deal</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt enacted a program known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Second New Deal</span> in 1935 which targeted the aid of a more specific group, such as farmers, workers of factories, as well as blacks.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Critics of FDR and the New Deal</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Father Charles E. Coughlin: Believed that Roosevelt was not strong enough of an advocate of an equal distribution of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Huey Long: A senator from Louisiana who was a champion of the poor and was well known for the way that he opposed FDR.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Dr. Francis Townshend: A champion of the elderly who wanted there to be a pension for older people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•American Liberty League: A group formed by Roosevelt's critics, primarily the ones that were advocates of business, that tried working against New Deal policies that they believed would lead the nation to socialism and a less desirable state.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Unions and Labor</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Committee of Industrial Organization (CIO) : A union group that was created upon the disagreement of leadership in the AFL because of the prospect of admitting industrial workers to the union that primarily allowed skilled workers. John Lewis founded the CIO and the group included non-skilled workers and blacks. They were known for these protesting tactics of sit-down strikes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Clashes with the Judiciary</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although Congress was usually on FDR's side when it came to passing New Deal legislation, the Supreme Court tended to more of an opponent of such legislation and would sometimes declare them unconstitutional. This greatly frustrated FDR, so in a scheme known as <span style="color: #007fff;">The Court Packing Plan</span>,  he asked Congress to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court by six members while carefully making sure that these justices would support New Deal legislation. This would give New Deal supporters a majority in the Supreme Court, which would in turn give FDR control of all three branches of government. The idea of adding justices was rejected by Congress, although the situation ceased to be a problem to Roosevelt as the old justices that had opposed his New Deal programs retired.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Additional Economic Downturns</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was another recession in 1938 that almost undid all of the economic progress that had taken place since the stock market crash. A new spending program was adopted by FDR in 1938 which ended the recession. FDR had a harder time passing legislation once Congress was controlled by the conservatives in 1938.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Native Americans</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Wheeler-Howard Indian Reorganization Act</span> ended the division of indian reservations in order to give away land to individuals. It also increased the amount of rights that indians on their reservations.</p>

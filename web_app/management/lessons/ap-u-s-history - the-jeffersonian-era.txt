<h2 style="text-align: center;">Jefferson Takes Office</h2>
<h3>Louisiana Purchase</h3>
Jefferson sent diplomats to France to arrange a deal with Napoleon to purchase new Orleans and Florida for 10 million dollars, although Napoleon offered all of Louisiana for 15 million. The purchase violated the constitution if interpreted in the narrow way that Jefferson normally did, although it could be justified by a much broader interpretation. <span style="color: #007fff;">Meriwether Lewis and William Clark</span> were sent on an expedition o discover the territory, where they were accompanied by the native american Sacagawea. They discovered many things about the new land and even developed trade routes and maps.
<h3>Marshall and the Supreme Court</h3>
Before Adams left office, he made a series of "<span style="color: #007fff;">midnight appointments</span>" for court justices in order for it to be controlled by Federalists. Jefferson then tried removing some of these appointees, although one of the appointees, Marbury, sued Jefferson for the right to his commission under the Judicial Act of 1794. In the Case <span style="color: #007fff;">Marbury vs. Madison</span>, Chief Justice <span style="color: #007fff;">John Marshall</span> ruled that Marbury did not technically have a legal right to his commission because the Judicial Act of 1794 was a piece of legislation that violated the constitutional, and therefore Marshall declared it unconstitutional. Thus, Jefferson won the case, although more importantly, Marshall's ruling gave the power of <span style="color: #007fff;">judicial review</span> to the judiciary, a power never used before although it would leave a great mark on the power of the judiciary for many years to come.
<h3>The Escapades of Aaron Burr</h3>
Angry over his loss in the race to become the governor of New York due to Hamilton's opposition in his campaign, he challenged Alexander Hamilton to a duel in which he shot and killed him. Burr fled west where he attempted to become the emperor of Western territories, when Jefferson ordered his arrest. Aaron Burr was acquitted and sent into exile.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Native Americans and Foreign Policy</h2>
<h3>Tecumseh and Tippecanoe</h3>
A native American chief, Tecumseh, united a large number of native americans and rallied the cry of stopping white settler's intrusion on their territory. The village of Tippecanoe was built to consolidate the native americans who promoted the cause. General William Henry Harrison of the U.S. led an army and attacked and burned down the village. Killing Tecumseh.
<h3>British Tension and the Embargo Act</h3>
Jefferson was frustrated by the British seizure of neutral American cargo ships and the impression of American soldiers during Britain's war with France. In 1807, a British warship, Leopard, fired at the American warship Chesapeake, killing a few Americans. America was on the brink of war although Jefferson handled the situation with diplomacy and peace, and by getting Congress to put the Embargo Act into effect as a way of punishing the British. <span style="color: #007fff;">The Embargo Act of 1807</span> prohibited American trade with any other country in order to cripple Britain by shortening its import needs, however Britain easily substituted the imports it once received from the U.S. with goods from other countries, while the Embargo Act devastated the American economy. Since it proved to be such a large failure, the Embargo Act was repealed by Thomas Jefferson in 1809, allowing trade with all nations except for Britain and France.
<h3>Macon's Bill No. 2</h3>
A bill was passed in Congress that would allow trade with either Britain or France, whichever nation recognized The United States' rights as a neutral nation and agreed to stop attacks on American ships. Napoleon of France agreed, so the U.S. resumed trade with France while it kept trade with Britain suspended, only to find out that Napoleon continued to seize American ships.
<h3>Madison's Election</h3>
In 1808, James Madison was elected to office as a Democratic-Republican and was backed by Thomas Jefferson during the election. However, Federalists did gain considerable control in Congress due to the widespread anger over the Embargo Act.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">War of 1812</h2>
<h3>Fighting the War</h3>
On June 16th of 1812, Britain finally stopped seizing American ships because it needed certain U.S. supplies, although not knowing this at the time, the U.S. declared war on Britain in 1812. Supporters of the war were known as <span style="color: #007fff;">War Hawks</span>, while people opposed to the war were typical New England merchants who called the War of 1812 "Mr. Madison's War". At first, Britain mainly attacked from the Canadian border, where AMerican troops were able to hold them off for the most part. The Americans won minor naval battles such as in Lake Erie and also off rh Coast off Nova Scotia with the U.S. warship known as the Constitution and nicknamed Old Ironsides. General William Henry Harrison also led America to victory at the Battle of Thames. In 1814, Britain defeated France, and then shifted it military focus toward America. Britain went to invade New York, but were driven back by U.S. troops. britain also invaded Washington D.C and burnt the capital, although it was stopped at Baltimore and Fort McHenry, after which battle Francis Scott Key wrote the <span style="color: #007fff;">Star Spangled Banner</span>. The British also attacked new Orleans, but were defeated by Andrew Jackson, although his victory was won nearly two weeks after the U.S. and Britain signed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Treaty of Ghent</span>.
<h3>Hartford Convention</h3>
A group of New England Federalists who were opposed to the war of 1812 met in Hartford Connecticut in 1814 to discuss what could be done about their dislike about the war, more moderate members present at the convention wanted a higher majority in both houses in order to declare war in the future, while more radical New Englanders discussed secession from the Union. These talks were quelled once the U.S. reached a treaty with Britain later that year.
<h3> Treaty of Ghent</h3>
The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, left both nations off the way they were beforehand, by only stopping fighting, and restoring prewar territory lines.
<h3>Nationalism</h3>
Although the U.S. suffered significant losses during the War of 1812, its ability to contend with a large world military and naval superpower ignited a spirit of nationalism in Americans, while the New England Federalists' anti-war attitude was seen as unpatriotic.

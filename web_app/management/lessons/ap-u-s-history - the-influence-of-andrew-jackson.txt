<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Age of the Common Man and Democracy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The 1830s, under the presidency of Andrew Jackson, was a time of social equality and democracy.The idea of a "self-made man" was popular, and such social equality was applied among woman as well, as though there was still a significant gender gap between men and women.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Change in Elections and Voting Requirements</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The sense of social equality was also elevated by changes in the structure of elections and politics. <span style="color: #007fff;">Universal male suffrage</span> was granted in a movement that started at first in new western states, which spread to all U.S. states until all men were allowed to vote, regardless of the property they owned. Also, elections became more democratic by the reduction in primary caucuses that were used to nominate candidates, which were only open to party leaders. They were widely replaced with nominating conventions that instead allowed all people to participate in the nomination of candidates. Also, presidential electors were now elected by the population rather than state legislatures, making presidential elections more democratic and making it more necessary for the campaigns to appeal to the masses.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Party Evolution</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The supporters of Andrew Jackson called themselves <span style="color: #007fff;">Democrats</span> while his opponents formed a party known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Whigs</span> who nominated henry Clay as their presidential candidate.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">States Rights</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jackson generally supported states rights, and his position was reaffirmed by his action of vetoing a bill, which was known as the Maysville Road Veto. Congress wanted to build the Cumberland Road in Kentucky, however Jackson vetoed the bill on the ground that it wasn't constitutional.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conflicts Faced by President Jackson</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Tariffs and the Nullification Crisis</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The protective tariff of 1828, also known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Tariff of Abominations</span>, was a raised version of the Tariff of 1824. John C. Calhoun and the state of South Carolina deemed that the tariff was unconstitutional, and because of that, it was susceptible to <span style="color: #007fff;">nullification</span>. The idea of nullification primarily stated that a state had the ability to decide wether or not to obey a federal law, and therefore declare it void, which was basically an idea derived from the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions many years earlier. Calhoun declared the nullification of another tariff in 1832. Angered, Andrew Jackson boldly got Congress to pass the Force Bill which allowed military action in South Carolina, while declaring that nullification was treason. Instead of engaging troops, Jackson instead compromised by lowering the tariff. However, his bold and powerful actions in the face of the crisis made militant southern rebels retreat.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Indian Removal Act</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Andrew Jackson love for democracy did not extend to native Americans; that was made clear by the<span style="color: #007fff;"> Indian Removal Act of 1830</span>. It forced many native americans to leave their land and move west of the Mississippi while leaving their land open to American settlement. Other states also forced tribes to migrate, and the Cherokee tribe tried suing Georgia. In a case known as Cherokee nation v Georgia, the court declared that the Cherokee tribe was not a nation and could not sue in court. Widespread movement of many native americans resulted in a very difficult time for the tribes in a period known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Trail of Tears</span>, where traveling conditions were incredibly stressing and tolling. The conditions killed thousands of native americans during the trek.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Peggy Eaton Affair</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">During Andrew Jackson's presidency, the wife of the secretary of state was a target of gossip amongst the other wives of the cabinet members because she was committed of adultery, making her a social outcast. Jackson felt for Eaton and tried persuading the wives of the cabinet members to accept Mrs. Eaton socially. The affair sparked controversy among Jackson and the politicians and their wives, and the heated conflict is what caused vice president John C Calhoun to leave office and have his place taken by Martin Van Buren.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Jackson and the Bank of the United States</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Andrew Jackson believed that the bank of the united states was unconstitutional, and so he vetoed the Bank re-charter bill in 1832, thus killing the bank of the united states. Jackson withdrew all federal funds and instead distributed the funds among states banks which were referred to as pet banks.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Specie Circular and the Panic of 1837</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to poor economic and financial policy, the price of western land badly inflated. Andrew Jackson attempted to resolve the crisis by mandating that all purchases of federal land were to be made with gold and silver rather than bank notes. The attempt made matters worse, making banknotes worthless and making land lose almost of its value, starting the economic depression known as the panic of 1837.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Election of 1840</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the Upcoming election, where Martin Van Buren was the democratic candidate and William Henry Harrison was the Whig candidate, Martin Van Buren and the Deomcrats were blamed for the poor economy, although it mostly was due to the national bank being killed by Jackson. The whigs launched a campaign for Harrison that was known as "<span style="color: #007fff;">Log Cabin and hard Cider</span>" that emphasized the humble beginnings of Harrison and his very self accomplished track record in battle. The denounced "Martin Van Ruin", and in 1840, William Henry Harrison was elected to office, thus making the whigs officially a national party. Harrison died very soon after taking office due to an illness, making his Vice President, John Tyler, take the office of the president. John Tyler was not a true whig, and his presidency upset whigs, and they referred to Tyler as "His Accidency"</p>

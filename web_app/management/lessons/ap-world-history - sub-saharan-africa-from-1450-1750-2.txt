<h2 style="text-align: center;">West African Slave Trade</h2>
The States that became the strongest in West Africa were those willing to cooperate with European nations. African states traded gold and slaves in exchange for guns and gunpowder. The Asante kingdom became powerful due to it's cooperation, minerals and agriculture. Internal trade networks were disrupted so the Europeans could control the trade. African states raided each other for goods to trade with Europeans, at times enslaving prisoners of war to trade. There was a triangular trade: slaves would go to the New World, raw materials like cotton, metals and sugar would go to Europe and weapons would go to Africa.

At first slaves were just servants; however, as colonies needed labor to man plantations slaves were treated harsher. Slaves were extensively used in the production of sugar and mining. An estimated 325,000 slaves were taken from Africa in the 17th century alone. It is believed over a million were taken in the 18th. Bringing Slaves to the new world was a terrible process known as the Middle Passage. People were packed in tightly in complete darkness. A quarter of slaves would die on the journey during the earliest years of trade.

Dutch settlers, known as the Boers, settled South Africa. The Boers established an agricultural society; it was based heavily on slave labor. A strong sense of racial superiority existed in their culture which led to apartheid. The Boers fought an African people, the Zulu, often. The British eventually took to the region. There was three way conflict between the Zulu, the Boers and British.

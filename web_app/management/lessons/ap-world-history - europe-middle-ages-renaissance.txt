<h2 style="text-align: center;">Christianity</h2>
Despite lack of intellectual hubs and central political authority, Europeans were tied together through common faith. After the dissapation of the roman empire, the Christian population split in an event known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Great Schism. <span style="color: #000000;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Roman Catholic</span> Church became a powerful force as locals would go to their church for learning and moral guidance. The Church would keep the calendars and any texts in a largely illiterate society. All Catholics were required to give a tenth of their </span></span>possessions to the church in a practice known as <span style="color: #007fff;">tithe</span>. The only way to move up in society was to join the clergy.<span style="color: #000000;">

The pope became the most powerful man in Europe. The pope had the right to kick anyone out of the worship of god. The pope also politically ruled land in Italy that was referred to as the Papal States. The popes would eventually declare holy wars known as <span style="color: #007fff;">Crusades</span> on nations in the Middle East, because they were occupying holy land.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Feudalism</h2>
No-one was able to centralize the large landmass of Europe. As a result local rulers arose. Nobility granted land to people who faithfully followed them. Serfs living on a lords land would have to pay rent, essentially creating a slave system. Lords would be subject to the rule of kings.

Due to the violent nature of the middle ages, nobility would have to raise armies. Nobility also fought as knights. They were virtuous christian warriors who followed a code of chivalry.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Kingdoms</h2>
Charlemagne was ruler of a Frankish kingdom. He defended his territory and took more. He was one of the few early European supporters of education and culture. For this reason the church declared him the Holy Roman Emperor.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Vikings</h3>
The Vikings would pillage and destroy towns. However, due to weak cultural sense vikings often assimilated into the cultures they would try to conquer. The vikings' raids lead for exchange of ideas between the different regions of Europe. The vikings ended up settling Greenland and Iceland. A viking explorer reached the Americas but no long standing colonization occurred.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">England</h3>
William the Conqueror established rule in England. Barons eventually made the king sign the Magna Carta, which limited the monarch's power.  Later a somewhat democratic Parliament was introduced. The English would extend their rule into Wales and Scotland.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">France</h3>
France became large and centralized. They had no obligation to share power. France eventually went to war with England in the Hundred Years War. England Attempted to take over France but failed after a couple initial victories.
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Spain And Portugal</h3>
Spain and Portugal eventually drove out the Moors in the Reconquista. Catholic Rulers Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon married to gain power. The marriage led to extreme religious intolerance leading to the Spanish Inquisition, which expelled all non-Catholics. The Muslim influence from the moors led them to more advanced technology which helped allow the Spanish to explore the world.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Crusades</h2>
The First Crusade occurred when the Byzantine Empire asked European nations for help in reclaiming Jerusalem which had been taken by muslims. The Crusaders Slaughtered every Jew and Muslim mercilessly. The Crusades let the Europeans have a foothold in the Middle East which allowed for trade. In the second two Crusades the Europeans lost miserably.

Europeans learned architecture and weapon technology. They also learned of the great trade routes that they would soon be a part of.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Trade</h2>
Trade routes followed water ways. Trading increased when soldiers brought back goods from the Middle East. Private banks started. In the Baltic an organization called the Hanseatic League facilitated trading.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cities</h2>
People started living closer together to ease trading. Monarchs greatly encouraged the growth of cities as they could tax without having to work through lesser nobles. Skilled workers met and created organizations to avoid being ripped off. Cities were often dirty and the home to many poor. Life in the city allowed people to escape serfdom.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">Plague</span></h2>
The Bubonic Plague erupted into Europe. In 6 years it killed approximately one third of the population. Poor sanitation allowed for the disease to cause so much damage. There was a lack of workers afterwards which allowed for the working class to gain rights.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Printing Press</h2>
Evolved from block printing, a movable-type printing press was created. Metal characters could be arranged to form text. This could be covered in ink, then pressed against paper. This allowed for the creation of libraries and universities. This spread of information paved the way for the reformation and renaissance.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Renaissance</h2>
The "rebirth" of Europe was inspired by found Greco-Roman texts. The renaissance emphasized worldly affairs and humanism. This contradicted the church's teachings that man was imperfect. The wealth of Italian banking families allowed for the supporting of the arts and increased trade. Famous Artists included Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Rafael. Machiavelli wrote how to be an effective leader, claiming the the ends always justify the means. Leonardo also studied the human body and left many ideas. The Italian ideas spread throughout the rest of Europe planting seeds of discontent with religion.

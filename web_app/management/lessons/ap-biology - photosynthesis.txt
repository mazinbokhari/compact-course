<span style="color: #007fff;">Photosynthesis</span> is a energy producing process that involves turning solar energy into chemical energy stored in organic molecules, like sugars, and then utilized later. This subject is covered to some extent on the AP exam, and often its critical to be able to note the similarities and differences between photosynthesis and <span style="color: #007fff;">cellular respiration</span>. Before we dive into the actual process, lets see where photosynthesis actually occurs...
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Chloroplast Structure</span></h2>
An <span style="color: #007fff;">autotroph</span> is a organism that produces its own energy, and often undergo photosynthesis. For the purposes of conceptualization, lets look at a plant to examine chloroplast structure, since its the most common autotroph. In a plant, photosynthesis occurs in the mesophyll layer of a leaf. Within the cells of the leaf, there lies a double membraned organelle called a <span style="color: #007fff;">chloroplast</span>. This is where the whole show happens.

Within the inner membrane of the chloroplast, a fluid called <span style="color: #007fff;">stroma</span> surrounds a system of membranous sacs called <span style="color: #007fff;">thykaloids</span>. These two structures are the main location for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. We'll get more involved into how they matter in a bit.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Photosynthesis Overview</span></h2>
The overall formula for photosynthesis is: <img alt="6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light Energy \rightarrow C6H12O6 +6O2" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?6&amp;space;CO2&amp;space;+&amp;space;6&amp;space;H2O&amp;space;+&amp;space;Light&amp;space;Energy&amp;space;\rightarrow&amp;space;C6H12O6&amp;space;+6O2" align="absmiddle" />

In this equation, water is split and the electrons harnessed are used to fuel the photosynthetic process, while the oxygens and hydrogens are paired with the carbon dioxide to form glucose (look C.B. Van Neal's bacteria experiment for further details). This equation represents two cycles in one. Solar energy is converted into chemical energy within <span style="color: #007fff;">light reactions</span>. Dark reactions or The Calvin Cycle involve carbon dioxide is mixed with pre-existing organic compounds by carbon fixation. Like many other cases in the world of biology, each of these cycles fuels the other.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Photosynthetic Pigments and Chlorophyll</span></h2>
Light exists in both wave and photon form. These forms of light are absorbed by pigments of chlorophyll within the chloroplasts. There are three types of pigments most commonly found in plants. <span style="color: #007fff;">Chlorophyll a</span> absorbs violet-blue and red light the best; it is the main pigment of most plants. <span style="color: #007fff;">Chlorophyll b</span> is a accessory pigment, meaning it supports main pigments by broadening the light spectra to help absorb maximum light. Finally, there are <span style="color: #007fff;">carotenoids</span> which are used for photo-protection, essential keeping the chloroplast from absorbing too much light.

***There are several types of graphs that depict light absorption by pigment types. Two graphs that frequently show up on the AP are the <span style="color: #007fff;">action spectra</span> and the <span style="color: #007fff;">absorption spectra</span>. An action spectra shows <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rates of photosynthesis</span> for a pigment under different wavelengths of light. An absorption spectra shows <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how much light is absorbed</span> for a given pigment at different wavelengths.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Light Reactions</span></h2>
Light reactions occur in <span style="color: #007fff;">Photosystems</span> within the thykaloid membrane within chloroplasts. These are multicellular stuctures that contain light harvesting complexes and a reaction center complex. Light harvesting complexes trap solar energy and pass it throughout the photosystem until it reaches the reaction center complex.  At this point the two specially joint chlorophyll a molecules within the reaction center will trap the excited electrons that have moved around from each light harvesting complex. These electrons will then be passed to the primary electron acceptor of the photosystem.

Before we move on, its important to note that there are two types of photosystems. Photosystem II (PSII) comes first chronologically and its chlorophyll a dimer is called P680; Photosystem I (PSI) comes second and its chlorophyll a dimer is called P700.

So lets continue...Once an excited electron is trapped by the primary electron acceptor the reaction center undergoes a redox reaction in which the first chlorophyll a is oxidized, losing its electrons. It's electrons are replenished through the splitting of a water molecule to form hydrogen ions and oxygen gas. The hydrogen ions later become very important. Up to this point, the excited electrons have only moved around. But after the first photosystem (PSII), the electrons enter an electron transport chain in which some the potential energy from the electrons is released by transport proteins. This energy is used to create a proton gradient that powers the synthesis of ATP, much in the same fashion as ATP synthesis in chemiosmosis.

Now, these electrons haven't lost all their energy, so they are moved to PSI. PSI utilizes the energy remaining in these partially excited electrons and traps energy in the same way as PSII. The only real difference is that P700 acts as the chlorophyll dimer. After a lot of bouncing around, the electrons move into another ETC where they are used in another redox reaction. Here, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH. Both NADPH and ATP become reactants for the second part of photosynthesis- The Calvin Cycle.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Chemiosmosis in Photosynthesis</span></h2>
In photosynthesis, chemiosmosis is very similar to chemiosmosis in respiration. Both have ETC's built into membranes. In Photosynthesis, the ETC lies in the thykaloid membrane. The proton gradient flows from the stroma into the thykaloid membrane and then diffuses back into the stroma, where ATP is phosphorylated from ADP + P. The ETC here is the initial structure that pumps the hydrogen ions into the thykaloid membrane. This ATP is then used in the Calvin Cycle.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">The Calvin Cycle</span></h2>
The Calvin Cycle is very similar to the Citric Acid Cycle. It turns thrice to fixate three molecules of CO2 into one sugar intermediate called G3P. G3P is then transformed into usable, more complex types of sugar like glucose. There are three phases of this:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carbon fixation</span>- carbon dioxide is added to a five carbon sugar called RuBP forming a unstable six carbon intermdiate. This six carbon molecule almost immediately spits into 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reduction</span> - Each molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated  into another intermediate compound which is reduced by NADPH to create one G3P molecule.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regeneration of CO2</span> - this is done to create an acceptor of RuBP at the beggining of the cycle. The rearrangement that happens here requires three ATP.</li>
</ol>
In total the cycle requires 9 ATP and 6 NADPH to synthesize one G3P. Remember, the products of the Calvin Cycle (NADH+ and ADP + P) are used to fuel the light reaction.

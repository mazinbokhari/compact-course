Cell respiration is a major topic on the AP exam, and rightfully so. It is one of the main ways organisms harvest energy. But before we jump into it, let us review a couple quick things to better understand this unit.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Review: Catabolic Reactions and Redox Reactions</span></h2>
There are a couple types of respiration. There is <span style="color: #007fff;">fermentation</span> - the breakdown of sugars without the use of oxygen to release energy. <span style="color: #007fff;">Aerobic respiration</span> involves the breakdown of some organic material using oxygen to release energy. Finally, there is <span style="color: #007fff;">anaerobic respiration<span style="color: #000000;">, which is like fermentation only sugar is not the organic material used. The common theme here is that respiration is a catabolic process, one in which things are broken down and energy is released. </span></span>

The way in which energy is released within these processes is through <span style="color: #007fff;">redox reactions</span>. These reactions consist of the transfer of electrons between molecules. The molecule that receives the electrons is called the oxidizing agent, while the molecule that loses an electron is called a reducing agent. In most of these processes, oxygen is the main oxidizing agent due to its large electronegativity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">***When these electrons are transferred, they incrementally lose potential energy. It is this potential energy that is used in respiration.</span>

The first form of respiration we will explore is aerobic respiration. There are three steps in this process: <span style="color: #007fff;">glycolysis</span>, the <span style="color: #007fff;">citric acid cycle</span>, and <span style="color: #007fff;">oxidative phosphorylation</span>.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Glycolysis</span></h2>
Glycolysis is a process which takes place in the cystol and doesn't require oxygen. The whole process consists of breaking down glucose down into two pyruvate acid molecules. Specifically, two ATP molecules are split into two G3P molecules, a common organic intermediate. Then the G3Ps are converted into pyruvate, yeilding 2 NADH and 4 ATPs by <span style="color: #007fff;">substrate-level phsophorylation</span> (enzymes transfer phosphate groups to ADP from a substrate). Thus glycolysis yields 2 net NADH and 2 net ATP.

On a side note, glycolysis is a very primitive energy harvesting process that is common to aerobic respiration and fermentation. Thus it can be said to be an evolutionary link between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, who did it before oxygen was widely available in the atmosphere.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Citric Acid Cycle</span></h2>
The pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are moved into a mitochondria where they are modified through several steps into a compound called Acetyl CoA. This interm transformation involves the reduction of NAD+ into NADH. Acetyl CoA is the starting compound of the citric acid cycle. It is added to oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is then decomposed back to oxaloacetate. This is what makes up one turn of the cycle. Each glucose molecule fuels two turns of the cycle, with each turn of the cycle producing three NADH and FADH2 (like NADH), one ATP, and one CO2 which exits the cycle.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Oxidative Phosphorylation</span></h2>
There are two parts to oxidative phosphorylation:

- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Electron Transport Chain</span>

The cristae of mitochondria (inner structural folds) have many little <span style="color: #007fff;">electron transport chains</span> embedded within them. The chain is comprised of proteins that facilitate the reduction and oxidation of the electron carriers of respiration (NADH and FADH2). A these proteins reduce and oxidize these electron carriers in assembly line fashion. The potential energy harnessed the proteins is used to pump hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space. This pumping of hydrogen ions sets up the second step of oxidative phosphorylation.

- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chemiosmosis</span>

The pumping of hydrogen ions creates a <span style="color: #007fff;">concentration gradient</span> of hydrogen ions which naturally flows from the intermembrane space to the mitochondral matrix. At the end of the electron transport chain, there lies the most important protein in the chain: <span style="color: #007fff;">ATP synthase</span>. As the concentration gradient builds up, the hydrogen ions are forced from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. The only place for the hydrogen ions to travel with the gradient is through ATP Synthase. This protein is built with a rotor mechanism, so that as hydrogen ions travel with the proton gradient, the rotor turns and catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP. Generally, 32 to 33 ATP molecules are created through this process.

***In total, one glucose molecule yields about 36-38 ATP molecules. However, it should be noted that cellular respiration only functions with 40 percent efficiency, and the rest is released as heat.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Fermentation and Anaerobic Respiration</span></h2>
Many organisms create ATP energy without using oxygen; they're electron transport chains (ETC) don't use oxygen as their final electron acceptor. These organisms use <span style="color: #007fff;">anaerobic respiration</span>. Organisms with no ETC or that generate ATP without oxygen undergo <span style="color: #007fff;">fermentation</span>. There are two main types of fermentation. Humans sometimes undergo <em>lactic acid fermentation</em> in which pyruvate is reduced to lactate and NAD+ is recycled constantly from NADH; this only happens when oxygen supplies are low. <em>Alcohol fermentation</em> occurs with other organisms where pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide is released. Overall, fermentation is much less efficient than aerobic respiration.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Respiration and feedback mechanisms</span></h2>
Like most mechanisms, respiration is controlled  through negative feedback to maintain metabolic efficiency. When the organism has adequate levels of ATP, the ATP molecules inhibit enzyme phosphofructokinase in glycolysis to slow down the whole system. This enzyme is also inhibited by citrate from the citric acid cycle. This inhibition works to synchronize all three processes in cellular respiration and increase efficiency.

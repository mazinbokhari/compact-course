Amerindians lived in small nomadic tribes. There didn't seem to be any definitive gender difference although men were typically hunters. A group known as the Anasazi, built clay structures called pueblos.  They believed allthings came from the earth so religion was practiced underground. A group near the Mississippi built large dirt mounds.

The Aztecs were a dominant force in the Central Americas. They had a city Tenochititlan. They forced the area around the city to pay tribute. They built pyramids to honor the gods. They worshipped the Sun and many of the same gods as previous societies in the area, including Quetzalcoatl. They believed in human sacrifice to provide the sun with nourishment. They dominated the area until the arrival of the Spanish.

Andean Civilizations domesticated the llama and alpaca. Women were essentially slaves unless they served in the church. These people developed terrace farming, which required extreme labor, but allowed infertile lands to become agriculture centers.

Large city fortresses were constructed. Mit'a requirements increased. THe Spanish would eventually destroy this empire.

<h3 style="text-align: left;">FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">THE BAY OF PIGS CRISIS</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kennedy and the CIA provided over one thousand Cuban exiles that were opposed to the rule of Castro with guns and supplies in order to invade the nation and take Castro out of power. The United States did provide the exiles with weapons and supplies, although it did not give direct military support, and the whole plan turned out to be a failure, with nearly all of the Cuban exiles being slaughtered and giving a bad reputation to the Kennedy Administration.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Soviets set up nuclear launch sites in Cuba, although the U.S., under Kennedy's command, was able to surround the island and not let any Soviet ships deliver the missiles to arm the launch sites in Cuba. Kennedy negoigated by promising that the U.S. would refrain from invading Cuba. Kennedy's decision and the way he handled the situation that could have easily turned into a disaster is considered one of his successes in foreign policy.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">DOMESTIC POLICY AND THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kennedy made attempts to end the current economic recession at the time through cutting taxes and other methods, although his efforts did not avail. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and was replaced by his Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Johnson Administration</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">DOMESTIC POLICY</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson was known for being effective at getting legislation passed, and he was able to pass a large tax cut that would hopefully stimulate great increases in spending in order to help lift the economy out of the recession.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson's domestic policy entailed a plan known as The Great Society; he was able to pass the followings policies and pursue the following plans for his Great Society:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•War on poverty</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">•<span style="color: #007fff;">Miranda v. Arizona</span>: Requires police or legal authority to read the arrested person their rights that were given in the 5th amendment.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">THE PROGRESS IN CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson enforced affirmative action in construction projects in order to make sure the provisions set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were followed. The following policies were passed to advance civil rights and liberties.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Civil Rights Act of 1964: Enforced the rules against segregation in public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•24th Amendment: Outlawed poll taxes, which were being used to keep African Americans from voting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•<span style="color: #007fff;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span>: The federal government registered some voters in areas that commonly used literacy tests.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVITIES AND MOVEMENTS</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Martin Luther King Jr</span>. became a powerful figure in the advancement of black civil rights, while he believed in peaceful protest and nonviolence, in opposition to Stokey Carmichael, who led a movement where blacks believed themselves to be superior, which was an idea known as black power.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•<span style="color: #007fff;">Desegregation of Little Rock High School in Arkansas</span>: Eisenhower ordered the involvement of the national guard in order to bring black students into the high school with using force and blocking out the furious protestors of the community.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Montgomery Bus Boycott: People boycotted the use of the public busing services in montgomery in order to demonstrate defiance of the segregation in busing systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Greensboro, North Carolina Sit-In: A group of black college students sit at a diner counter and refuse to move until they are served.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">•March on Washington: About a quarter million people, both white and African American, participated in a large march to express their opposition of persecution and the discrimination of blacks. This march is where Martin Luther King delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There was also a significant advancement in the civil rights of Mexican Americans in the 1960s with strong leaders such as César Chávez.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">WOMEN'S RIGHTS</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Women's Rights also became a popular and widely supported demand in the 1960s, with women specifically wanting to be paid the same as men for the work that they did. The Equal Rights Amendment, which would have guaranteed equal rights for women, was passed by Congress although it was not approved by the state legislatures, thus denying its passage of becoming law. The National Organization for Women, known as NOW, also worked for promoting and supporting women's rights during this time period.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">THE VIETNAM WAR</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Vietnam split into North and South Vietnam after World War II, with North Vietnam being under the control of the communist party and the Vietnamese leader <span style="color: #007fff;">Ngo Dinh Diem</span>. The North began to attack the south, with its communist militants known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Viet Cong</span>. Because of the <span style="color: #007fff;">domino theory</span>, which was the belief that once one nation fell to communism then many others would follow, the U.S. sent military support to Vietnam in hopes of establishing a democratic government there. After the start of the Vietnam War, although war was not officially declared, the nations had to substitute its economic focus on food and other consumer products for producing war goods, and this substitution became commonly known as the tradeoff of "guns or butter". Johnson also had to cut the social programs and pull back some of the aid that he was giving in his Great Society.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Passed in 1973 by Congress while overriding a presidential veto in order for it to be put into effect, was Congress' way of putting the president in check with regard to his power of mobilizing the military in another country. It required the president to notify Congress within at leaf 48 hours before sending troops, and it also required their approval of mobilizing such a force. The Resolution was commonly ignored by most presidents.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> THE GULF OF TONKIN RESOLUTION</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson's way around the War Power Resolution was by asking Congress to allow the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which basically gave Johnson the authority to mobilize American troops in southeast Asia upon his command and without the approval of anybody else.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">FURTHER WAR EVENTS</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson tried to force a quick surrender out of the Vietnamese communists by bombing North Vietnam, in Operation Rolling Thunder, although the North Vietnamese had a different plan in mind, for they intended to drag on the war and win by outlasting the Americans. The amount of troops started out relatively small, around 10,00 in 1963, although by 1969, the amount of U.S. troops in Vietnam had climbed up to over 500,00 men. With these large increases in the amount of men being sent to fight in Vietnam, the disapproval rate for the war rose with certain people back at home. People were also angered and against the war because of the way Johnson dealt with it and refused to tell Americans the truth about the war directly. Supporters of the war were known as <span style="color: #007fff;">hawks</span>, while people who were against the war or participated in antiwar protests were known as <span style="color: #007fff;">doves</span>. Due to the war and some of the decisions Johnson was forced to make, he eventually lost his Great Society that he worked had to get legislation passed for and also  the presidency due to disapproval among Americans and the competition he faced in Eugene McCarthy and Robert McCarthy. There were some previous oaths that were broken by the United States throughout the course of the Vietnam War. Johnson stopped sending more American men to fight in Vietnam, he ended bombing on North Vietnam,  and also withdrew from running in the 1968 presidential election.</p>

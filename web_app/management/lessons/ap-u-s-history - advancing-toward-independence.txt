<h2 style="text-align: center;">Salutary Neglect and Mercantilism</h2>
Mercantilism in the mid 1700s spurred an increase in competition between European nations, although England had troubling regulating the colonial coast and discovering smuggling activity under the Navigation Acts. This lead to a period of Salutary Neglect, where the mother country left the colonies alone and didn't interfere with their activity until 1764.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The French and Indian War and the Aftermath</h2>
The series of wars between England, France, and Spain were at first primarily fought in Europe to gain supremacy in trade and in the colonies, although during the fourth war, the Seven Year War or the <span style="color: #007fff;">French Indian War</span>, the fighting location shifted toward the colonies. The colonists mainly fought the war at first, although Britain saw the colonists as incompetent of fighting a war against major Empires, so they began sending British troops to the colonies.
<h3>British Success</h3>
The British were being defeated in the early stages of the war, although eventually they won and signed the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In the aftermath of the war, hostility was developed between the colonists and Britain because they believed that their war efforts were under appreciated, and they were proud of their personal attempts to defend the colonies. They were not impressed with the British militia and thought that their battle tactics were poorly suited for fighting in the woodland of the Americas. The Seven Years War gave the colonies a newfound confidence in their abilities to defend themselves in a period of war.
<h3>British Action After the War</h3>
The series of four wars took a toll on Britain and required a large sum of revenue to pay for the vast costs of war. This tax pressure was at first laid on the wealthy British, although it was shifted to the shoulders of the Colonists after the war. The British recognized the importance of defending their American frontier, and responded by sending large amounts of troops to the colonies. British favor of making the colonists pay more for the cost of the British Empire as well as the increase in British troops in the colonies marked the end of Salutary neglect and the beginning of colonial and British tension.
<h3>Pontiac's War</h3>
In response to the encroachment of settlers in Native American lands and frustration with poor treatment, native Americans under the leadership of Chief Pontiac attacked and destroyed English settlement on the American frontier. The English relied on British rather than colonial troops to handle the rebellion. The rebellion ended with the English putting the Proclamation of 1763 into effect, which didn't allow colonists to settle west of the Appalachian Mountains . The legislation had the intention of protecting the colonies, although it was met with colonial protest on the basis that their liberty and representation in British government was being violated.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">English Taxes and Regulations</h2>
<h3>Townshend Acts</h3>
Placed an import tax on glass, tea, and paper and was enacted in 1767. This tax placed the burden indirectly on the colonists because the merchants had to directly pay the tax while it influenced the prices of the goods that the colonists payed for. John Dickinson wrote "<span style="color: #007fff;">Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer</span>" in an effort to unite the colonies in their protest of British taxation without representation that was evident in the Townshend Acts. The Townshend Acts were repealed in 1770 due to a decrease in revenue because of colonial boycotts and protest on the basis of taxation without representation that was initiated by John Dickinson. However, Parliament left the tax on tea to remain as a way of insisting on their right to tax the colonies.
<h3>Quartering Act</h3>
Mandated that colonists allowed British troops in their homes and provided adequate hospitality.
<h3>Sugar Act (Revenue Act of 1764)</h3>
Placed a tax on molasses and other luxuries. It differed from other duties because it directly raised revenue for the crown.
<h3>Stamp Act</h3>
A tax enacted in 1765 that required colonists to buy a specific stamp that had to be placed on almost all kinds of official legal documents. It was faced with severe protest from the colonists because it was the first direct tax on the colonists rather than the indirect duties that merchants that imported British goods had to pay. Patrick Henry raised the popular cry of "taxation without representation" to unite colonists in protest of the Stamp Act. The colonial gang that was devoted to defying British control over the colonists in an unfair manner, known as the Sons of Liberty, attacked merchants willing to pay the Stamp tax as well as tax collectors.
<h3>Declaratory Act</h3>
Upon Parliament's repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766, Parliament also put the Declaratory Act into effect which stated theat the crown had the ability to levy taxes on the colonies in all cases whatsoever. The Act replaced the brief rejoicing in the colonies with renewed protest and conflict between Britain and the colonies.
<h3>Tea Act</h3>
In 1773, Parliament made the price of the British East India Company's tea cheaper than that of other nations' tea, even with tax remaining from the Townshend Acts included. This Act led to the Boston Tea Party.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Further Causes of Colonial-British Conflict and Tension</h2>
<h3>The Boston Massacre</h3>
British soldiers stationed in the Boston to defend British officials from the colonial gang "<span style="color: #007fff;">The Sons of Liberty</span>" were harassed by a group of colonists in 1770. The soldiers shot at the mob, killing five colonists. John Adams defended the soldiers and court and led to them being acquitted.
<h3>The Boston Tea Party</h3>
The Tea Act led to colonists further boycotting British tea, regardless of the price because buying it would recognize the crown's ability to tax the colonies without their representation in levying such a tax. A ship full of British tea arrived in Boston Harbor in 1773, and at night a group of colonists dressed up as native americans dumped all the tea into the harbor to express their defiance of British taxes on the colonies.
<h3>The Coercive Acts</h3>
The colonial expression of defiance present from the Boston tea party angered the king and brought on a series of punishing acts in 1774 known as the coercive acts, or intolerable acts.. These acts prohibited trade activity in the harbor until the damage of the tea was payed for, as well as an increase in British power in colonial government and extensions to the Quartering act.
<h3>The Quebec Act</h3>
The Quebec Act of 1774 was also passed to punish the colonies for the Boston Tea Party along with the Coercive Acts, which mandated that the extended province of Quebec would be directly controlled by Britain. The Act angered colonists because it negated new colonial claims to the land in the province and it also allowed the practice of Roman Catholicism.

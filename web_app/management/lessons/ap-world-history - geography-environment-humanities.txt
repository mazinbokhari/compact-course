<h2 style="text-align: center;">Geography</h2>
<h3>Regions</h3>
Australia and the surrounding islands are often referred to as <span style="color: #007fff;">Oceania.</span>

Africa is considered the birthplace of humanity. Africa holds the vast <span style="color: #007fff;">Sahara Dessert</span> in its center. Africa is often talked about in three distinct regions: <span style="color: #007fff;">West Africa</span> (The Gold Coast), <span style="color: #007fff;">East Africa</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">Sub-Saharan Africa</span>. Similarly, Asia is often separated into <span style="color: #007fff;">East Asia</span>, <span style="color: #007fff;">Central Asia</span>, <span style="color: #007fff;">South Asia</span> (India), <span style="color: #007fff;">Southeast Asia</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">Southwest Asia</span> (The Middle East). Europe and Asia can be referred to together as Eurasia. Because of the heavy interaction between these three landmasses, together they can be referred to as Afro-Eurasia.

North and South America were originally inhabited by migrants from Eastern asia that crossed a land bridge between Northeastern Asia and Northwestern America.
<h3>Bodies of water</h3>
Once civilizations learned to travel across water, it was much faster and cheaper to travel across water as opposed to land. The <span style="color: #007fff;">Atlantic, Indian</span>, and <span style="color: #007fff;">Pacific <span style="color: #000000;">Oceans all served as important means of travel, food and resources for many </span></span>societies. The Caribbean and <span style="color: #007fff;">Mediterranean</span> Seas both were critical in the development of several civilizations. Africa is home to several large rivers including the <span style="color: #007fff;">Nile</span> and the Congo. Southwest Asia is home to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that helped to form the <span style="color: #007fff;">Fertile Crescent</span>. South Asia is home to the Indus and Ganges. The Huang-He (Yellow) and Yangzi Rivers are located in East Asia. The Mississippi River is in North America and the Amazon is in South America.
<h3>Requirements for a SOCIETY</h3>
To thrive a civilization needs

-A reliable source of water

-Land that allows for mobility

-Fertile land

-A reasonable climate

-A nearby trade route

-Natural Resources
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Migrations</h2>
Early hominids are believed to have been in Southern or East Africa approximately 3 million years ago. The earliest humans evolved about 150,000 years ago near the Rift Valley in East Africa. These humans began to migrate. This is referred to as the "<span style="color: #007fff;">Out of Africa" Theory</span>. Early humans were likely to move from East Africa to the Middle East. Some likely moved from there to South and Southeast Asia. From Southeast Asia some moved to Oceania. From the Middle East, humans eventually started to populate the rest of Eurasia. From Asia, some nomads crossed the Bering Land Bridge into the Americas.

<h3>Technological advances</h3>
To shield themselves from harsh weather early societies required innovation. Caves and Canyons were used for shelter. Humans soon learned to build wood, stone and bone structures that resembled tents or huts.

Fire was used to heat structures, scare potential predators and cook food.

Tools were made to aid early humans in acquiring food. Spears, knives and axes were common. Mats and Baskets were also used for gathering food.
<h3>Social Organization</h3>
Most groups of people tended to be family or in some way related. Almost all groups were hunter-gatherer societies. Many would migrate following food, called <span style="color: #007fff;">nomadism<span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span>

There was minimal social hierarchy in these groups. Councils, elders and sometimes chiefs would exercise some authority. There was no land ownership and minimal private property. Different tribes traded with each other; this allowed for spread of ideas and religious beliefs. Most early spiritual beliefs focused on the natural world; this is known as totemism or animism.

In all early societies there was gender division of labor. Because men are stronger they would hunt and perform construction. Women would gather plants and care for children.

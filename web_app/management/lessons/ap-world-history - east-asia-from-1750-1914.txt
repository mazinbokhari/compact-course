Originally, Europeans were only allowed to trade in the port of Canton. Then the dynasty began to decline with the rise of European Imperialism.

In the Taiping Rebellion was a terrible civil war plaguing Qing China. Hong Xiuquan convinced followers he was sent by God as Jesus' younger brother to form a heavenly kingdom in China by force. Ordinary Chinese saw this as an opportunity to escape the Qing's high taxes and joined. The rebellion was eventually put down.

Cixi controlled her nephew who was emperor of China. She was against any reformation that appeared to be pro-western. She became oppressive. As a result there was more discontent.

The Boxer Rebellion was aimed at foreigners, but it also burnt temples and forced the Qing to rethink their rule. Eventually local assemblies were formed and a national assembly was planned. A Nationalist party emerged before the national assembly came to fruition. China was temporarily ruled by this party.

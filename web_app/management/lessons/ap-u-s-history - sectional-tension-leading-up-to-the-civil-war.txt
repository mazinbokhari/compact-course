<h2 style="text-align: center;">The North and South Become Hostile over the Issue of Slavery</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Fugitive Slave Law</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under the strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, marshals could hunt escaped slaves and return them to their masters, there were heavy fines against anyone who helped a slave escape. The law was made to diminish the expanse of the underground Railroad which was a well planned out system made to help slaves escape. The North reacted by given caught slaves trials before they were returned, which angered the South.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Anti-Slavery in Literature</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A book by Harriet Beecher Stowe called <span style="color: #007fff;">Uncle Tom's Cabinet</span> added fuel to the fire because the book described the in-depth horrors that were part of a slave's life. The upsetting description caused more people to sympathize with slaves.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Dred Scott Decision</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dred Scott was a former slave who reached Wisconsin, a free state. He sued for his freedom on the ground that his time on free soil made him a free man. Dred Scott lost the case under the ruling that he couldn't sue in court because he was and African American and that the framers didn't intend for African Americans to be citizens of the UNited States. Also, the court argued it couldn't take away any personal property, including slaves. The Dred Scott decision pleased Southerners while leaving Northerners in shock and adding additional sectional tension to current matters.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Violence in Kansas</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stephen A. Douglas introduced a bill to Congress that called for the building of a railroad that would stretch from Chicago to the western states. <span style="color: #007fff;">The Kansas Nebraska Ac</span>t would provide that the land that the railroad would pass through would be divided into two states: Kansas and Nebraska. The land's slavery status was to be decided by popular sovereignty, and then ban slavery north of the lateral 36' 30''. The Act caused numerous Southerners and Northerners to rush to the new states to add their slavery or anti-slavery influence to the vote of popular sovereignty. Fighting and violence broke out between the groups, making the term "<span style="color: #007fff;">Bleeding Kansas</span>" stick.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The New Constitution of Kansas</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The writing of constitution of the Kansas was rigged by people who supported slavery. They rigged the election of people who were to draw up the constitution so that there were more proslavery than antislavery members. The outcome was the <span style="color: #007fff;">Lecompton Constitution</span>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Raid in Harper's Ferry</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">John Brown</span> led a raid in Harper's Ferry, Virginia in 1959 by trying to arm and rally slaves in a revolt. Federal troops captured Brown and ended the violent uprising. The matter shocked and angered southerners, and made more moderate Northerners frown upon Brown's use of violence, however he was firmly supported and hailed by abolitionists.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Politics</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Political Parties</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Kansas Nebraska Act destroyed party unity during the vote for the act and the Whig party altogether because it had hardly any sectional unity, it was more of a compilation of ideas and personalities. With the Whigs gone, for they did not run another presidential candidate in 1852, new sectional parties emerged, such as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Free-Soil Party</span>, and the Republican Party.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1856</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the election of 1856, most of the votes had an obvious sectional influence. The Democratic candidate, Buchanan, was a Northner who supported the South on most issues. The Republicans elected John C. Fremont and ran an anti-slavery campaign, although they were not technically running an abolitionist campaign. Buchanan and the Democrats won the election, however, the Republicans made an incredibly strong showing for a new party.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Douglas Loses Support in the South</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, ran against Stephen A. Douglas for senator where they both took place in numerous debates. In one of the debates, Lincoln frankly asked Douglas if he supported the Dred Scott decision or popular sovereignty. Attempting to make a non sectional response, Douglas attempted to be diplomatic and not directly take the South's side on the matter in his official response that was known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Freeport Doctrine</span>. The doctrine caused him to lose the support of Southern Democrats during the election for the presidency in 1860.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1860</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the election of 1860, the Democrats split into North and South sections when electing a presidential candidate. The Northern Democrats nominated Douglas while the Southern Democrats nominated John Breckenridge of Kentucky. The Constitutional Union Party was a non sectional party who chose John Bell of Tennessee as its candidate. Lincoln and the Republicans ended up winning ht election, mainly because of the division of the Democratic party.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Secession from the Union and the Formation of the Confederacy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union after the election of Lincoln. After South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Alabama, and Louisiana also seceded from the Union. The seceded states formed the Confederate States of America and picked Jefferson Davis to be their president. Lincoln declared a state could not decide on its own to leave the Union, and asked the southern states' reconsideration. Instead, the Confederates attacked a ship that was bringing supplies to <span style="color: #007fff;">Fort Sumter</span>. The attack was the official beginning of the Civil War.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Pastoralism</h2>
Humans learned to domesticate dogs to facilitate hunting. Sheep, pigs and goats were domesticated afterwards. These animals provided early societies with food, but the animals' need to graze kept early pastoral societies mobile. Oxen and horses were next domesticated to be sources of transport and labor. Animals provided these societies with a stable source of food, which allowed them to become more advanced over time.

The herds of animals required large quantities of grass that would not be in one place all year long. This encouraged nomadic lifestyles. The mobility encouraged the development of primitive wheeled vehicles. These societies would often come into contact with each other. This lead to the sharing of ideas and technology which is <span style="color: #007fff;">cultural diffusion</span>.

Early pastoral societies had animals selectively breeding which led to favorable traits for humans becoming prominent in domesticated animals. Some herds destroyed natural grasslands, leaving them as barren deserts.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Agriculture</h2>
Societies also learned to domesticate plants. Agriculture was partially independently developed, but it spread to some regions because of cultural diffusion. Societies would trade seeds and planting techniques. Societies depending on agriculture settled in a specific area. The first notions of private property first emerged in these societies. A steady supply of food allowed for people to have jobs other than providing food. Social structure  became more complex due to <span style="color: #007fff;">specialization of labor</span>.

Plant seeds were chosen leading to plants more favorable to humans. Some villages would change the land to allow for better crop yields, in a process known as <span style="color: #007fff;">irrigation</span>. Early engineering feats such as building dams and canals were achieved.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Early Cities</h2>
<h3>Reasons for Civilizing</h3>
Cities had

-A stable supply of food for all

-Protection from other societies

-Protection from wildlife

-A hierarchal society where an individual could obtain a spiritual society
<h3>Innovation</h3>
With a stable society of food many were allowed to work on bettering other aspects of society. The wheel and plow were invented in early cities. The plow made farming much easier and more land could be cultivated. Early textile processes were used to make clothing. Pottery allowed for storage of goods. <span style="color: #007fff;">Metallurgy</span> (getting metal from ore) allowed for better tools to be produced. Writing allowed for records to be kept. <span style="color: #007fff;">Polytheistic</span> <span style="color: #000000;">religions (having many gods) made their debut in early cities. </span>

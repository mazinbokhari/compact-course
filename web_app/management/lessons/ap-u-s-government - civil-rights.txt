<h2 style="text-align: center;">Blacks and Civil Rights</h2>
The acquisition of civil rights for blacks occurred in a very successive order.
<h3>The 13th Amendment</h3>
The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery.
<h3>The 14th Amendment</h3>
The Fourteenth Amendment, as you know, was crucial for incorporating civil liberties. However, its Equal Protection Clause also gave citizenship to former slaves, repealing the Dred Scott decision, which said that blacks were not citizens of the United States
<h3>The 15th Amendment</h3>
The Fifteenth Amendment enfranchised black males (gave them the right to vote).
<h3>Brown v. Board of Education</h3>
The Supreme Court overruled the decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (allowing "separate but equal" public accommodations) by saying that the provision of "separate but equal" is intrinsically unequal.
<h3>Equal Pay Act of 1963</h3>
This law made it illegal to base a worker's pay based on race, religion, or gender.
<h3>The Civil Rights Act of 1964</h3>
Despite the federal government's attempts to stop racial segregation, many state and local governments, mainly in the South, continued to separate blacks from whites. This forced Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made any sort of discrimination based on race, religion, or gender, illegal. This included the end to all Jim Crow Laws (basically more racial segregation laws).
<h3>The 24th Amendment</h3>
The Twenty-fourth Amendment outlawed poll taxes.
<h3>The Voting Rights Act of 1965</h3>
Congress also passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protected blacks' right to vote by stopping practices used largely in the South to disenfranchise them. The outlawed tactics were:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 22px;">Poll taxes - many blacks were poor and could not afford the fee to vote</span></li>
	<li>Literacy tests - many blacks were uneducated and therefore could not pass these tests to vote</li>
	<li>Grandfather clauses - bascially allowed poor and uneducated white men to vote by saying that anyone who had a grandfather that voted before 1867 was also allowed to vote</li>
	<li>White primaries - blacks were not allowed to vote in primary elections</li>
</ul>
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 also let the federal government regulate elections in states that had less than half their populations registered to vote.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Race and Affirmative Action</h2>
Affirmative action is basically preferential treatment towards a certain group for a reason. There are a couple main points you should know about affirmative action:
<h3>Reason</h3>
This kind of ties in with civil rights, but whatever. The Supreme Court has ruled that any categorization based on race or gender must have a compelling or moderate, respectively, reason. Affirmative action is allowed as a "plus factor" in admissions decisions in the interests of promoting diversity. Therefore, promoting diversity is a good reason (in the Supreme Court's eyes) for colleges' use of affirmative action.
<h3>Quotas</h3>
Colleges are not allowed to use quotas as a part of their affirmative action process. For example, colleges may not require that their incoming freshmen classes must have a composition of at least 30% blacks.
<h3>Cases</h3>
I don't believe you'll be tested on specific cases, but I'll list them anyway:
<h4>University of California v. Bakke</h4>
The Supreme Court ruled that quota systems are unconstitutional, but affirmative action can be used as a "plus" factor.
<h4>Grutter v. Bollinger</h4>
The Supreme Court upheld the ruling in the previous case.
<h4>Gratz v. Bollinger</h4>
The Supreme Court once again upheld Bakke by ruling that a college's admissions process placed too much emphasis on race.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Women and Civil Rights</h2>
There's not much about this topic covered on the AP exam. Some things you should know are:
<h3>Leaders of Women's Rights</h3>
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony, and Betty Friedan.
<h3>The 19th Amendment</h3>
The Nineteenth Amendment enfranchised all women.
<h3>The Equal Rights Amendment</h3>
This was an attempt at an amendment to basically guarantee everyone equal rights, but it was not ratified by Congress.
<h3>The Seneca Falls Convention</h3>
This was just a convention that tried to stop discrimination against women.
<h3> Other Stuff</h3>
Women gained rights in order ways, such as contraceptive rights, abortion rights, and gained fights from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These all have already been mentioned.

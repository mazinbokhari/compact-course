Organic molecules make up the basis for biological study at the macro-molecular level. However, this chapter on its own is not covered thoroughly on the AP exam. It is still important to have a base level knowledge of this. There are four main molecules: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, and Nucleic Acids.  These are all formed from smaller molecules.

With this chapter, its important to clear up a few terms. <span style="color: #007fff;">Monomers</span> are identical, small molecules; monomers are joined together to form <span style="color: #007fff;">polymers</span>- chain-like, larger molecules. Polymers are often synonymous with macro-molecules.  Now, the common way monomers are joined to form polymers is through <span style="color: #007fff;">dehyration synthesis</span>. This process generally involves stripping a hydrogen atom and a hydroxide atom from the constituent monomers, and then linking them, all while releasing the new water molecule. The opposite of this is<span style="color: #007fff;"> hydrolysis</span>, which involves adding a water molecule to break a polymer into its monomers.  Now, lets move onto our basic polymers
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Carbohydrates</span></h2>
Carbohydrates are basically sugars. Their function is to be burned or stored as fuel; however, some carbs can be used for structural purposes. The carbohydrate monomer is called a <span style="color: #007fff;">monosaccharide</span>. These have the general chemical formula of (CH2O)n (n signifies how many times you multiply that bases formula). Monosaccharides are linked through dehydration synthesis to form <span style="color: #007fff;">Polysaccharides</span>. They are linked by<span style="color: #007fff;"> glycosidic linkages</span>. Note that the function of monosaccharides is to act as quick fuel, whereas polysaccharides act as storage or structural molecules. Starch (plants) and Glycogen (animals) are two storage carbohydrates most common in organisms. Common structural carbohydrates include cellulose, which is used in the cell wall of many plans and other organisms, and chitin, which is utilized by insets and some fungi as an exterior shell.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Lipids</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lipids are also used for stored fuel, but play a huge part in making up cell membranes and provide a basis for horomones. Note- lipids cannot be considered macromolecules because there is no definite monomers of them. There are three types of lipids: <span style="color: #007fff;">phospholipids</span>, <span style="color: #007fff;">steroids</span>, and <span style="color: #007fff;">fats</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">***The linkage most common in lipids is called an <span style="color: #007fff;">ester linkage</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Phospholipids are made of a glycerol molecule linked to two fatty acids and a phosphate group. Phospholipids are interesting because they have a <span style="color: #007fff;">hydrophilic</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="color: #007fff;">hydrophobic</span> side, whereas usually all lipids are nonpolar. Hydrophillic means attracted to water; hydrophobic means repelled by water. As a result, phospholipids have a hydrophilic head, and a hydrophobic tail. This dual nature allows them to make up a majority of cell membranes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Steroids are lipids connected with carbon rings and with several functional groups attached. Their ring shape will always distinguish them. Steroids provide the base for almost all hormones (long distance chemical messengers). Cholesterol is a common steroid in animals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fats are the last class of lipid. They consist of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. <span style="color: #007fff;">Triglycerides</span> are synonymous with Fats. They can be made up of either unsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids have a double or triple bond, while saturated fatty acids only have single bonds.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Proteins</span></h2>
Proteins have a wide range of functions in organisms. They include enzymatic functions, transport, movement, cell signal reception, defense and structure. The monomer of a protein is an <span style="color: #007fff;">amino acid</span>. Amino acids are linked together to form a <span style="color: #007fff;">peptide bond</span>. When this is done multiple times, a <span style="color: #007fff;">polypeptide</span> results. Multiple polypeptides joined together yields a protein. There are four levels of protein structure, since they are so complex.

- Protein Structure:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Primary: genetically coded amino acid sequence</span></li>
	<li>Secondary: polypeptide backbone is folded and coiled; hydrogen bonds are present here and determine the shape of the secondary structure.</li>
	<li>Tertiary: amino acids can have side chains called R-groups. There side chains interact and determine the tertiary structure of the protein. Depending on the side chain, interactions involve hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and covalent bonds.</li>
	<li>Quaternary- when multiple polypeptides come together, this structure is formed</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Nucleic Acids</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nucleic acids are the macromolecules that carry genetic code. They consist of a phosphate group linked to a nitrogenous base. There are two types of bases: Pyrimidines and Purines. Adenine and Guanine are Pyrimidines; Cytosine and Thymine are Purines. That is all you need to know right now, the rest is covered in the DNA section about nucleic acids.</p>

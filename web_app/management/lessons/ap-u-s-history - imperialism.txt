<h2 style="text-align: center;">Foreign Policy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the 1800s, the period of <span style="color: #007fff;">isolationism</span>, or the concentration of growth and development within North America had come to an end, giving rise to the period of <span style="color: #007fff;">imperialism</span> that was embraced by President McKinley.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Hawaii</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hawaii requested annexation from a separate government that American planters established in their defiance to the control of the Hawaiian Queen, Liliuokawani.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Spanish-American War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Citizens who were strong advocates of the nation aggressively expanding its power and settlement abroad wanted the nation to obtain Cuba from Spain, with by means of violence if necessary. Cuban nationalists had already initiated a revolt of their own by destroying Spanish plantation in Cuba, and <span style="color: #007fff;">yellow journalists</span> in the United States did every thing to make headlines as dramatic as possible in an attempt to rally and unite the nation in a war effort in order to expand and support the movement of imperialism.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Motivation to Begin War</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">De Lome Letter</span> was another factor that spurred people to support the war effort, which involved the U.S. intercepting a Spanish letter that was highly critical of the American president and  the government. It created a large amount of hype  among the indignant Americans. The incident that practically sealed the deal of America going to war with Spain was an incident referred to as "<span style="color: #007fff;">Remember the Maine</span>". The event entailed an American ship called the Maine that was docked in a Cuba harbor, when it spontaneously exploded killing almost three hundred Americans that were on the ship. The causes of the explosion were unknown, although patriotic and imperialism-supporting Americans didn't hesitate to blame the Spanish and have the rest of the  nation join them in their cries of rage and war against Spain.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The U.S. Becomes Involved In Cuba</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">McKinley decided to intervene in Cuba, but only for the good of the Cubans so they could establish their own government, which he explained in a document known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Teller Amendment</span> which was sent to Spain. Upon the declaration of war, the assistant secretary of the navy, Theodore Roosevelt, ordered the naval commodore Dewey to seize the lands of the Philippines that were under Spanish rule at the time. The Americans then captured Manila later in the year of 1898. Americans and Cubans fought  in Cuba, with many troops dying of disease.  A memorable moment in the war was when the rough riders under Theodore Roosevelt were victorious on San Juan Hill. U.S. battleships practically destroyed the Spanish naval fleet in July at Santiago Bay which practically was the cause of the United States winning the war and forcing Spain to come to them with wishes for peace which was established in the <span style="color: #007fff;">Treaty of Paris</span>.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Cuba After the War</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the U.S. victory in Cuba, it passed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Platt Amendment</span> which prohibited foreign intervention from any other nation in cuba, and it also established America's ability to restore order and control in Cuba. In 1934, Cuba became its own nation, repealing the amendment to the nation's constitution.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">China</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Trade Interests</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">John Hay implemented the <span style="color: #007fff;">Open Door Policy</span> that ensured that the United States would pursue its interest in China among the other foreign countries that had interest in trade with China.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Boxer Rebellion</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">A group of Chinese Nationalists who were against foreign influence gave rise to a rebellion and attacks on foreign settlers. The U.S. sent troops in order to ensure the protection of its people and its property that was in China.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Big Stick Policy</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The "<span style="color: #007fff;">Big stick policy</span>" was a term used to describe Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy because of its aggressiveness. Roosevelt became president in 1901 after the death of President McKinley, for Roosevelt was vice president at the time.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Panama Canal</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt helped the people of Panama in their revolution in return for an amount of land that would be used to build the Panama canal, which would allow for the passage of boats through Panama, eliminating the necessity of traveling all around the Continent of South America.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Roosevelt Corollary</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt's<span style="color: #007fff;"> Roosevelt Corollary</span> made the U.S. responsible for policing South American countries and ensuring that other nations didn't use violence to collect their debts from them, while taking a certain amount of control of the South American country in order to ensure its ability to restore itself so it would be able to pay off such debts. Since it declared that the U.S. would have total authority and would readily use force in a certain territory, the Roosevelt Corollary was often compared with the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Dollar Diplomacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under the Taft Administration, Taft being Roosevelt's successor, the United States pursued a foreign policy in Latin America and China known as "<span style="color: #007fff;">Dollar Diplomacy</span>". The policy basically included the U.S. having more influence and investment in China at the expense of blocking out Japan and European countries from doing so.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Moral Diplomacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under the Wilson Administration, Wilson being Taft's successor, the United States acted more in favor of what was morally right than what was in the best interest of American businesses. The policy was put to the test during the Mexican revolution, while American businesses supporting the current government under the dictator Huerta. Wilson refused to support Huerta because of his brutality, so when the Mexicans failed to overthrow Huerta, Wilson tried to aid by sending in U.S. troops. The act ended in the failure, and ended with the Mexican people rioting.</p>

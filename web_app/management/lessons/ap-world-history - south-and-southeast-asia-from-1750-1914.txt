<h2 style="text-align: center;">India</h2>
India was referred to the jewel in the crown of Britain's empire. Britain expelled the French from India. The British East India Company essentially became the government of India. India was extremely profitable. The company defeated Mughal forces that had much greater numbers than theirs. The British started out owning only parts of Bengal. By 1810, the British owned over one-forth of India. They jailed many Indian soldiers in a prison known as the Black Hole of Calcutta. The British used India to grow a lot of cotton. They British overtaxed Indians and often seized peasants' land. The British educated and trained some indians. Indians rebelled in the Sepoy Mutiny, due to the belief the British were forcing them to religious dietary restrictions. There were many casualties on both sides, so the British Government took direct control of India, instead of the British East India Company.

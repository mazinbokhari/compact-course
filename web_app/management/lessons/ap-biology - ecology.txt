This quite possibly is the biggest topic that is featured on the AP Biology exam. This is due to the fact that it's so interconnected with many other topics and because its very large. Ecology shows up on both the multiple choice and the free response. <span style="color: #007fff;">Ecology</span>, in a nutshell is the study of the organisms within an area interact with the environment of that area.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Ecology Overview</span></h2>
There are several types of ecology. <span style="color: #007fff;">Organismal ecology</span> focuses on how the organisms in an ecosystem interact and their specific behavioral and physiological characteristics. <span style="color: #007fff;">Population ecology</span> looks at the size of different populations of organisms in an ecosystem and the affects of this size. <span style="color: #007fff;">Community ecology</span> examines how different organism interact with each other and act as a community within a ecosystem; this type of ecology is the most prominent of the group. <span style="color: #007fff;">Ecosystem ecology</span> studies how chemical cycling and energy flow affect the functioning of ecosystems.

Ecosystems are made up of both biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) entities. The interaction of biotic characters alters gene pools and affects entire ecosystems. Abiotic factors are equally important. There are four staple abiotic elements.
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 22px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Temperature</span> is essential because it heavily influences metabolism of organisms. Most organisms function in a small range of temperatures</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water</span> varies by habitat and the abundance of it reflects the organisms and their distribution within an ecosystem</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Light/Light energy</span> is the engine driving a majority of ecosystems. The availability of light determines the size and complexity of an ecosystem due to its affects on primary producers (aka plants).</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soil</span> also affect the plant life in an ecosystem and lays the groundwork for the structure of an ecosystem.</li>
</ol>
<span style="color: #007fff;">Climate</span> is another big element of an ecosystem. An ecosystem's climate is the weather conditions within the area. This determines the light availability, water availability, and temperature of the ecosystem. Fun fact: the tropics are receive the most light energy and the least variability of solar radiation, allowing them to be the most diverse of the world.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Population Ecology</span></h2>
A <span style="color: #007fff;">population</span> is a group of organisms that are the same species occupying the same area in an ecosystem. The individuals in an ecosystem are in frequent contact with each other; they interbreed and share resources regularly. There are two main factors in population ecology that influence all else in population ecology. One is <span style="color: #007fff;">density</span>, or the individuals in a given measure of area. The second is <span style="color: #007fff;">dispersion</span>, which is the spacing of the organisms within an area. Lets look at each in a little more detail...

Population density is measured through sampling an area of an ecosystem for individuals of a certain species to get an idea of how many are there total. Now a population's density and size are affected by a couple things. They grow larger through <em>birth</em> and <em>immigration</em> of individuals into the population; they decrease through <em>death</em> of individuals and <em>emigration</em> of individuals out of the ecosystem.

The dispersion of a population can come in many forms. A <em>clumping</em> pattern of individuals shows a high level of social interaction between individuals. <em>Uniform</em> distribution indicates competition among individuals and high interaction as well. <em>Random</em> spacing shows a lack of interaction between individuals.

-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population Growth Rate Models</span>

Population ecology often times looks at how a population size increases or decreases and how this effects the ecosystem as a whole. Sometimes there may be a math grid-in problem on the AP exam that focuses on these types of growth models. The formula will be given on the formula sheet. The critical variables to be familiar with are...
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">b = per capita birth rate</span></li>
	<li>d = per capita death rate</li>
	<li>N = population size</li>
	<li>r = rate of population growth</li>
</ul>
There are two types of growth models: exponential and logistic. The <span style="color: #007fff;">exponential growth</span> <span style="color: #007fff;">model</span> is seen in normally in newer, growing populations that are regrowing from a disaster or filling an empty niche (purpose in an ecosystem). When graphed, it produces a J-shaped curve. In this model, the larger the population grows, the faster the growth rate becomes. A <span style="color: #007fff;">logistic growth model</span> is seem much more often in nature. This is where a population grows exponentially to a point and then growth slows to almost a zero slope. The point at which the growth rate peters off is called the <span style="color: #007fff;">carrying capacity</span> (K), which represents the maximum population size an ecosystem can support. Many times, if a population following the logistic model exceeds the carrying capacity, then limited resources and death rates will naturally restore the population size to carrying capacity or cause the population to die out (due to some extraneous factor). This model produces a S-shaped curve when graphed.

-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life History traits and types of organisms</span>

The organisms which inhabit an ecosystem come in different lifestyles, and their lifestyles affect the growth model the population takes on. <span style="color: #007fff;">Life history</span> is a term used to describe how a species reproduces and takes care of its young. Note-  each ecosystem's situation is different and natural system will favor a life history based on it's own population densities and other abiotic factors. The first main type of life history is <span style="color: #007fff;">k-selection</span>. Here, traits that increase competitive ability to find resources is favored. K-selection occurs in ecosystems in which population densities are high. Usually, organisms that reproduce less frequently and take more care of their offspring follow k-selection. An example would be humans.

<span style="color: #007fff;">R-selection</span> is the second type of life history; it favors maximum reproductive potential with respect to time and quantity. R-selection is prevalent in ecosystem with low density populations. Organisms that trive in r-seletion usually reproduce quickly and have several offspring; they engage in little to no child rearing. An example would be fruit flies.

-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population Regulation</span>:

Population densities are regulated through two things: <span style="color: #007fff;">density dependent</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">density independent</span> factors. Density dependent factors are things that affect growth rates of a population proportionally as population density increases. Examples include food and resource supplies, disease, predation, or even accumulation of wastes. Density independent factors are factors that affect growth rates with no correlation to population density. Examples here include weather, climate, or even natural disasters.

-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous Population Dynamics Info</span>:

Population dynamics is the study of the factors that affect populations and the variations that result. Much of this field, for the purpose of this course, focuses on predator-prey cycles and population stability. Predator-prey cycles are the growth and decline of populations of predators and prey in line with each other. Population stability is reaching the carrying capacity and maintaining it; this is basically where there is zero population growth. This can be attained through high birth and death rates or low birth and death rates.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Community Ecology</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Community ecology is the most important and involved of the ecological topics covered on the test.  A <span style="color: #007fff;">community</span> is made up of several different species populations that interact in various with each other and the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community interactions</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Interspecific interactions</span> between different species is very common in a community, and is classified by whether they aid, hurt, or have no visible effect on the organisms involved. One of the most common interactions is <strong><span style="color: #007fff;">interspecific competition</span></strong> between species for a shared, limited resource; this often impacts population size, growth, survival and reproductive success. When competition occurs, the <span style="color: #007fff;">competitive exclusion principle</span> states that the weaker, less efficient competitor will die out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each species has its own <span style="color: #007fff;">ecological niche</span>, in other words its role in the environment and usage of resources. An organism's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fundamental niche</span> is the complete role it CAN play in the ecosystem; its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">realized niche</span> is the actual role it ends up playing after all other community members are accounted for. When two species share the same niche, they often cannot coexist due to resource limitation. The competitive exclusion principle takes effect and one species dies out. Another possible scenario involves <span style="color: #007fff;">resources partitioning</span>. This is where the competing species will slightly change their niche to coexist.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other important interactions include <span style="color: #007fff;">predation</span>, <span style="color: #007fff;">herbivory</span>, and <span style="color: #007fff;">symbiosis</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Predation is basically what you think it is... one organism eating another (prey). Often times, predators and prey adapt to each other in unison, with the predator adjusting after the prey does.  Prey often use mechanisms to protect themselves like cryptic coloration, where a non threatening species mimics the coloration of a threatening species to ward off predators. Herbivory is like predation, only this time the organism eats plants. Symbiosis is a relationship between two different species in direct contact with each other. There are three types of symbiosis. <em>Parasitism</em> is where a parasite feeds off a host; its a pretty one way relationship where one benefits and one is hurt. <em>Mutualism</em> is a relationship that benefits both organisms involved. Finally, <em>commensialism</em> is where only one seems to be benefiting from the relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Structure</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A community's diversity is based upon the abundance of different species present in the community and the sheer quantity of individuals within each of the populations. The size of a ecosystem and species diversity are driven by the primary producers of the ecosystem...but we will get into that in a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The tropic structure in a community shows each class of organism, from primary producers to upper level predators. Tropic structures can be represented by food chains, which show the energy transfer between levels, or food webs, which show the specific feeding relationships between prevalent organisms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As each tropic level feeds off the next, energy is lost in the process. ***The energetic hypothesis states that approximately 10% of energy is able to travel up a tropic pyramid (from each level to the next) toward predators. Essentially its more efficient to eat primary producers since no energy has been lost yet. When we eat meats, some energy has already been lost due to the metabolic functions of the animal we just consumed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Certain species are very important to a community's structure; they can alter the way an ecosystem functions. The <span style="color: #007fff;">dominant species</span> have the highest number of individuals and the largest biomass within the community. They often influence the distribution and suvival of other species, because of their dominant resource usage. An <span style="color: #007fff;">invasive species</span> is like a pioneer within a growing ecosystem. They can fill and grow in an array of empty niches due to a lak of predators. Finally, a <span style="color: #007fff;">keystone species</span> is a species which has a huge impact on the cmmunity and how it functions. They link to multiple tropic levels and keep a balance within the community.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Distrubances and Ecological Succession</span></h2>
Disturbances within an ecosystem can be both good and bad. Although things like storms, droughts, human destruction threaten the existing species and the stability of an ecosystem, they can increase diversity and produce chances for newer species to fill open niches.

Ecological succession is essentially the rebirth of an ecosystem after it dies. These transitions usually follow a major disturbance where the ecosystem is severly damaged or completely destroyed. There are two types of succession. <span style="color: #007fff;">Primary succession</span> involves the soil, the basic growing environment of the primary producers, being destroyed. It's a complete turnover. <span style="color: #007fff;">Secondary succession</span> is where the soil remains intact. In both forms, early colonizing organisms facilitate the improvement and habitability of the ecosystem so that they may grow once more.

If you think this lesson is long...imagine how long it took me to write it LOL....:'D..... but lets continue.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Energy Transfer and Ecosystems</span></h2>
Ecosystems are powered by solar energy; this energy is converted into usable chemical energy by autotrophs, primarily plants. All other herbivores and carnivores feed of this base amount of chemical energy that plants produce from photosynthesis. Energy is eventually lost from the ecosystem as heat. Thus, energy really functions as a cycle within ecosystems.

This energy cycling shows us a couple of things. Firstly, conservation of energy occurs as energy moves through an ecosystem; it flows and converts between forms, but its never lost. Secondly, mass is conserved in ecosystems through chemical cycling and net input/output of the ecosystem as a whole.

Tropic levels become important when it comes to understanding energy transfer. <span style="color: #007fff;">Primary producers</span> are autotrophs that synthesize organic compounds using sunlight. Herbivores are <span style="color: #007fff;">primary consumers</span>; <span style="color: #007fff;">secondary consumers</span> are carnivores. Now, the size of an ecosytem is based upon the <span style="color: #007fff;">primary production</span> of that ecosystem, which is the amount of solar energy that is able to be converted by the primary producers. This is because<em> the rest of the trophic levels feed off the primary producers for energy</em>.

Lastly, when energy is transffered between tropic levels, the actual energy that makes it to the next level rages from 5-20 perccent. This is called <span style="color: #007fff;">tropic efficiency</span>.

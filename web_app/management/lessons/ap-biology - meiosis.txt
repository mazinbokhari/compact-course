<span style="color: #007fff;">Meiosis</span> is the process of producing haploid sex cells, or gametes. It's very similar to mitosis, but the biggest difference is that meiosis is made up of two sets of divisions: <span style="color: #007fff;">meiosis I</span> and <span style="color: #007fff;">meiosis II</span>. Meiosis II is basically the same as mitosis in that the number of chromosomes is maintained. Even though we didn't go into detail about the individual steps of mitosis, we should definitely look at the steps of meiosis I...
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Meiosis I</span></h2>
Meiosis I begins with <span style="color: #007fff;">prophase I</span><span style="color: #000000;">. This is where the differences are really set up. The nucleus disappears here and the chromatin condenses into chromosomes. Here's where it gets weird. After the chromosomes are fully formed, homologous chromosomes are paired up in a process called <span style="color: #007fff;">synapsis</span>. So, basically when these pairs line up in metaphase I along a metaphase plate, you can see two pairs of sister chromosomes. These units of paired chromosomes are called <span style="color: #007fff;">tetrads</span>. A special process occurs during synapsis called <span style="color: #007fff;">crossing over</span>. This is where adjacent chromosomes within the tetrad will exchange genetic material at a place called chiasmata.</span>

After crossing over occurs, the rest of the steps in meiosis I are really the same. The tetrads line up in metaphase I and are separated into two different daughter cells in anaphase. <em>***Note that because the tetrads separate instead of actual chromosomes, the number of chromosomes is cut in half in meiosis I. </em>The two daughter cells will eventually be haploid after meiosis I. In meiosis II, the chromosome number will be maintained.

Meiosis' ultimate purpose is to create sex cells for sexual reproduction. There lie many mechanisms within meiosis to create much needed genetic variation within gametes.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Genetic Variation</span></h2>
The sexual reproduction that meiosis sets up, results in cells with variable genetic material. This variability is called <span style="color: #007fff;">genetic recombination</span>. Three events are the source for recombination:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crossing over</span>: the exchange of genetic material between adjacent chromosomes in a tetrad furing synapsis create genetic material totally unique from either parent cell. </span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Independent Assortment</span>: the orientation of the tetrads during metaphase I and the separation of each chromosome during anaphase I is random. This randomness means that each gamete doesn't receive the identical set of chromosomes each time duing metaphase and anaphase I.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Random joining of assortment</span>: although a female contributes probably only one egg, it is completely random which of the male's sperm cells ends up fertilizing the egg. This adds more variability into the process of sexual reproduction.</li>
</ul>

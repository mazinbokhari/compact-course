<h2 style="text-align: center;">Readmitting the Confederate States to the Union</h2>
<h3>Ten Percent Plan</h3>
Lincoln had to think of a way to readmit Confederate states that were previously in rebellion back to the union.  He came up with the following plan. The Union would readmit any states that had at least 10% of the voters in that state take the oath of allegiance to the Union and accept the freedom of slaves. Due to the way the requirement for readmission to the union mandating an oath of allegiance from 10% of voters in the state, this idea of Lincoln's was known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">ten percent plan</span>.
<h3>Wade-Davis Bill</h3>
Congress though that Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan was being too lax on state readmission and that the plan would make it easy for a state that got readmitted to be completely controlled by ex-Confederates and sectionalists. They proposed another bill that they thought would make for a stricter, loyal, and not sectionalist reconstructed state. The bill was called the <span style="color: #007fff;">Wade-Davis bill</span> and would plan to readmit states that had at least half of the citizens of their states to have taken an oath of allegiance to the Union as well as to only permit non Confederate affiliated officials to draw up the new state constitution. Lincoln pocket vetoed the bill.
<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Presidency of Johnson</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Lincoln's Assassination</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, and afterward Vice President Johnson was appointed to the office of the presidency.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Johnson's Origins and Beliefs</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Johnson was originally from the South, and was a white supremacist who though the war was necessary to preserve the Union. Because of this, Johnson often clashed with the propositions and ideas of the radical republican Congress. Jackson lost even more support from Congress when he vetoed a bill that would allow the Black Codes in the south.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Reconstruction Progression</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">By 1865, all of the 11 states that had seceded from the Union had rejoined the Union while ratifying the freedom of slaves under the Thirteenth Amendment. There were also some old Confederate leaders that held government positions such as in Congress. Southern states allowed adopted black codes that would limit the rights and abilities of the newly freed slaves in the south. Some examples of the black codes were the way blacks were prohibited to purchase land or even sue a white in court.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Further Opposition to Jackson in Congress</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Jackson gave a series of speeches where he gave explanations as to why it would be a bad idea to give completely equal rights to blacks and what kind of society that would make. Republicans in Congress were angered and retaliated by accusing Jackson of being an unintelligible traitor and they raised a rally with an action known as "<span style="color: #007fff;">waving the bloody shirt</span>" to gain support among Northerners to remind them of all the blood that was shed to win the war.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Protection of Blacks Through Legislation</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Freedman's Bureau</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Freedmen's Bureau</span> was set up by the federal government in order to help blacks that were jobless. The Bureau. It tried to give blacks southern lands that were taken by the Union during the war. It also helped build schools for these southern blacks and taught them to read.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Civil Rights Act of 1866</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Congress attempted to protect free blacks from the oppression and discrimination they were faced with under the Black codes in the South. They tried doing this by passing Civil Rights Act of 1866 which made all blacks in the United States U.S. citizens. The legislation was only a temporary protection because it could be repealed if a southern majority ever existed in Congress. Congress obtained its permanent solution by passing the <span style="color: #007fff;">fourteenth amendment</span> which made all people that were born or naturalized in the U.S. citizens of the nation. The amendment also extended all rights and protections of U.S. citizens to those persons. The fourteenth amendment also limited the political influence of the south by not allowing ex-Confederates to hold state or federal government official positions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The 15th Amendment</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Congress also passed the <span style="color: #007fff;">fifteenth amendment</span> amendment which ultimately extended voting rights to all blacks and denied the states' ability to withheld any citizen that right for any reason.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Congress Puts Pressure on the South and Jackson</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Congress passed the Reconstruction Act of 1867, overriding Johnson's veto, which put the ex-Confederate states under military control. The act also mandated that the ex-Confederate states ratify the fourteenth amendment in order formally rejoin the Union.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Johnson's Impeachment</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Congress also passed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Tenure of Office Act</span> over Johnson's veto which made it illegal for the president to remove any government official without the consent of Congress. Johnson disobeyed the Act by firing a radical republican official, the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Upon this act, the House impeached Johnson, and the Senate tried him, but the vote was just one vote short of removing Johnson from office.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1868</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Republican candidate and war hero, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidential election in 1868.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Grant Administration</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Civil Rights Act of 1875</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This Act promoted and granted social equality in public places for all people including African Americans, although policy was poorly enforced and made hardly any impact. Eight years later, the Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Republicans in the South</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Republicans also took control of southern states while they were under military control to ensure that they met the requirements for reconstruction. Eventually, the Republicans were withdrawn from the states. These southern Republicans were detested by native southerners and were called <span style="color: #007fff;">scalawags</span>, while southerners called people who moved North "<span style="color: #007fff;">carpetbaggers</span>".</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Freed Blacks in the South</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The newly emancipated slaves often lived in communities together with their family, or they moved to frontier states or northern cities where they would be less serrated by the rest of the population. Blacks also made an effort to educate themselves and their future generations. Blacks established many churches, most commonly Baptist or Methodist after leaving the white dominated ones. Freed blacks also commonly became sharecroppers where they would work a farmer's land in return for a piece of their own land to harvest.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Corruption</h3>
Grants administration was known for the political corruption that was common under his presidency. There were multiple large and well-known scandalous incidents that occurred during the time.
<h3>Credit-Mobilier Affair</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stock experts gave advice to members of Congress in order to cover up they way they were taking advantage of their own insider knowledge to make market decisions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Whiskey Ring</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A scandalous conspiracy that included the diversion of tax money from liquor companies to federal revenue agents.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Boss Tweed</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In local governments, there were political machines that brought corruption to cities, with William Tweed, known as Boss Tweed, being the most notorious political boss in New York City. He stole large amounts of money with his political machine known as the "<span style="color: #007fff;">Tweed Ring</span>" from taxpayers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1872</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Republican party nominated Grant again, while the Democrats and the liberal Republicans nominated Horace Greeley, who died, granting Grant the reelection.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Panic of 1873</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overbuilding and too much growth in industry led to an economic depression in 1873 known as the Panic of 1873. Grant later gave in to the advice of banker and attempted to resolve the crisis by printing additional greenbacks.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Persecution of Blacks in the South</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">White Supremacy was widespread in the 1870s, when the Ku Klux Klan was at a high level of power. The KKK was an organization founded by an ex-Confederate general who promoted the use of terror tactic to frighten freed blacks in the south from exercising and using their own rights. The tactics often included violence, and the government stepped in to help prevent the violence in 1870 with the Force Acts.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Election of 1876</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the election of 1876, the republicans elected Rutherford B. Hayes while the Democrats nominated Samuel j. Tilden. The electoral votes were very close, with Tilden only needing one more electoral vote from three last contested states in order to win the election. A special counting committee was organized to decide which candidate would receive the final electoral votes from the states. The committee gave all the votes to the Republican, Hayes, which angered the Democrats and caused the necessary implementation of the <span style="color: #007fff;">Compromise of 1877</span>. The Compromise arranged that Hayes would be president, the building of a transcontinental railroad in the south would be supported, and the support of Republicans in the south would cease.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The South by the Late 1800s</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Barriers Between Blacks and Voting</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the South, freed slaves were granted the right to vote by the 15th amendment, although the South use other methods that didn't go against the 15th amendment directly in order to prevent blacks from voting. Common examples of such tactics included:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•The Grandfather Clause</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Literacy tests</p>
•Property Qualifications
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Segregation</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Jim Crow Laws</span> were also in effect in the south that caused segregation between blacks and whites in public facilities. The Ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, declared that "separate but equal" public accommodations were constitutional, thus ending any hopes for a quick fix to segregation in the near future. The NAACP helped blacks hold onto their rights in the midst of the discrimination that they were facing. African Americans responded by living in their own established communities among each other that placed a high amount of significance on church.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Economic Advancement in the South</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The South by the 1890s had improved its economic state greatly since its state of ruin after the civil war. Cotton production increased, and also the increase in the amount of railroad tracks in the land promoted the rapid growth of business and industry in the South that had not existed before.</p>

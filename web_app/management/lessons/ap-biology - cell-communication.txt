Cell communication shows up often on the AP exam, both on the multiple choice and free response. This is due to the fact that cell communication links to lots of other biological topics, like development and basic biological processes like feedback control. It also takes place between both unicellular organisms and the cells of multicellular organisms.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Cell Communication Overview</span></h2>
Overall cell communication is made up of several <span style="color: #007fff;">signal transduction pathways</span>. A signal transduction pathway is defined as the process of turning a signal on cell's surface or within the cell into a cellular response. There are essentially three stages in communication through a pathway:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">reception</span> - involves the binding or reception of a signal on or inside a cell</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">transduction</span> - series of steps that convert the signal into readable information for the cell structures working at the destination of the signal.</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">response</span> - the cell structures acting after the transduced signal is read.</li>
</ul>
Lastly, there are two types of cell signaling: long distance and local. Long distance signalling includes the nervous system and hormones; both of these examples spread a signal large distances from the signals origin. Local regulators include the neurotransmitters released at neural synapses and cystolic communication through plasmodesmata and gap junctions. Now, lets go in depth inside each of the steps within cell communication...
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Reception</span></h2>
Reception usually beings with a <span style="color: #007fff;">ligand</span>, or a signalling molecule, binding to a receptor protein; sometimes this causes a change in the shape of the receptor protein inducing transduction. There are some special types of receptors that need to be known in depth for the AP. The first three work with the plasma membrane while the last one is intracellular.
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">G-protein linked receptors</span>: when a ligand binds to this receptor, a G-protein will be activated. This occurs through the replacement of a GDP molecule attached to the G-protein with a GTP molecule. The G-protein then goes on to turn on another membrane bound enzyme, which triggers the transduction. After activating another enzyme, the G-protein is deactivated; all of this happens within thr cystol. This type of reception is used by several neurotransmitters and hormones and occurs in development and sensory reception.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Receptor tyrosine kinases</span>: these can trigger many different pathways instead of just one. Once a ligand binds to two receptors, they form a dimer. The tyrosine kinase (bottom) tail of rach receptor on the cytoplasmic side becomes phosphorylated after reception. These phosphorylated tyrosines now serve as a binding dock for an array of relay proteins. Once these relay proteins activate, they can trigger multiple pathways.</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Ligand-gated ion channels</span>: this receptor changes shape when a ligand binds to it. The ligand either opens or closes a "gate" within the receptor protein that regulates the flow of a certain ion. Usually, the activation or decativation of such a receptor will change the ion concentration within the cell, and in turn cause a cellular response. Neurotransmitters in the synapse function like this.</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff;">Hydrophobic messengers</span>:some ligands that are hydrophobic cross through the cell membrane and bind ot receptor swithin the cytoplasm or even the nucleus. Steroid hormones sometimes act like this to influence the production of proteins by acting as a transcription factor within the nucleus.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Transduction</span></h2>
Signal transduction pathways often allow a small signal to be amplified through relaying of the signal to produce a bigger cellular response. Relay proteins become very important in transduction as they transfer signals between receptors and the proteins that cause a response. <span style="color: #007fff;">Protein kinases</span> are enzymes that often act in phosphorylating proteins by stripping phosphates from ATP. Thus, the activated protein is enabled to continue to communication. <span style="color: #007fff;">Protein phosphatases</span> are enzymes that work against kinases. They dephosphorylate and "turn off" certain proteins after they have done their job. <span style="color: #007fff;">Second messengers</span> are water-soluble molecules that relay a signal from a first messenger further along the pathway. Examples include cAMP (cyclic AMP) and calcium ions (when G-protein receptors or kinases are used).
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Response</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">These transduction pathways can result in an array of responses including activation of transcription factor (manipulate the expression of certain genes), activation of cytoplasmic enzymes, open or closure of protein channels, etc. Another important thing to not about these signal transduction pathways is how much they can amplify a resoonse from a signal cascade incolving hundreds of kinases and relay proteins to produce one or multiple responses.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Apoptosis</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apoptosis is signaled cell death. Lysosomes and break down organelles and everything is packaged into vesicles.These vesicles are then phagocytically swallowed by scavenger cells. Regardless of the reason for apoptosis, this process is one of the best examples of a signal transduction pathway. Ligands are released in response to damaged DNA, diseased cells, and cancerous cells too.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mughal India</h2>
Babur and his Mongol hoard destroyed the Delhi Sultanate. He established his own Mughal Empire. It was another Islamic empire that used gunpowder to achieve military supremacy. India's economy was based on the export of cotton. Hinduism and Buddhism were accepted. The Taj Mahal was built. Women were allowed to work and own property. They could receive education. However, the Islamic beliefs restricted women. The hindu practice of sati (setting oneself on fire when one's husband died) was still allowed. Akbar the Great was an extremely tolerant emperor. He abolished taxes that specifically targeted non-muslims. A bureaucracy was established.

Later, the empire stopped its policy of toleration. Sikhs were infuriated and rebelled. They established their own state, Punjab. More areas became independent. Delhi was sacked.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">English Dominance</h2>
Europeans were eager to exploit the wealth of South Asia. The Dutch, French and English all tried to claim parts of India but the Mughal Empire was able to stop their efforts. When the Empire was dismantled the British East India Company took the City of Bombay. The English fought and won a war with the French, so they were able to colonize the entire Sub-Continent.

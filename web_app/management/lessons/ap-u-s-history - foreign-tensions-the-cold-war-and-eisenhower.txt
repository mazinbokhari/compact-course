<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Nation After World War II and In the Beginning of the Cold War</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domestic Policy</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Demobilization</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coming back from the war, the industry and factories had to convert back to being able to produce consumer goods instead of war goods. The soldiers coming back from the war did replace women who were working in the industry to an extent, although women had been considerably more involved in working in the industry ever since World War II.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> Unions and Labor</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United Mine Workers and the railway workers threatened a strike due to their demand for higher wages. Truman responded by seizing both the mines and the railway although at the end of the matter, the unions got most of what they wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Truman also show his lack of sympathy for unions and labor when he vetoed the <span style="color: #007fff;">Taft-Hartley Act</span>, which was a policy that would put a lot more restrictions and limitations on unions regarding their power and frequency of action or striking. the Act also gave more power to the employers rather than the employees or laborers.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> Civil Rights</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Truman proposed for Congress to:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Establish the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Create a vivil rights commission that would be permanent</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•End segregation in public accommodations and schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Outlaw lynching</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">--His requests were rejected by a conservative Congress--</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Foreign Policy</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Truman and Communism</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Truman thought that they best way to deal with the Soviets and communism was by just leaving it alone to deal with its own problems, while ensuring that it didn't expand, for the hope was that it would eventually fail due to the lack of a proper and effective system. This idea was known as <span style="color: #007fff;">containment</span>.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Truman Doctrine</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Truman Doctrine</span> was Truman's decision to provide a large amount of aid to Greece and Turkey in order to prevent it from falling to the communists, since Britain was no longer able to provide aid there itself. The doctrine was successful in preventing these nations from almost surely falling into the hands of communism.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"> The Marshall Plan</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">A plan that was more radical and had plenty of opposition, for it would entail the additional involvement of the U.S. in Europe in order to subside the existence and growth of communism. The plan was approved by Congress.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Berlin Crisis and the Airlift</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Western Germany was experiencing a change for the better since after the war under control of the U.S., Britain, and France. In a situation known as the <span style="color: #007fff;">Berlin Crisis</span>, the Soviets blocked the path to Western Germany in order to force the Western Powers to come to some of compromise to appease them, although the we tern powers refused and instead continued to support and ship goods to western Germany by the use of an airlift. The more had frustrated and outmaneuvered the Soviets while evading war, which frustrated the Soviets. Recognizing their defeat, the Soviets stopped blocking the path to Western Germany in 1949.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Revolution in China</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After a civil war in China, the communist party known as the People's Republic of China took over China and was led by<span style="color: #007fff;"> Mao Zedong</span>. The U.S. refused to continue foreign and diplomatic relations with the communists and instead supported the Chinese nationalists that were defeated and that had fled to Taiwan.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Korea</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the war, Korea was divided into the North and South, with the North being overseen by the Soviets and the Soviets being overseen by the U.S. until the nations had gained footing and structure in their government. The North Koreans then invaded South Korean territory, upon which action the U.N. sent troops to support South Korea with the vast majority of these troops being U.S. troops led by General Douglas MacArthur. Douglas MacArthur was finally able to push the north Korean communist forces north pas the 38th parallel, and then finally, against the wishes of Truman, continued his offense and attacked China. MacArthur was removed from command and also lost support from Congress. Peace negotiations had made no progress once Truman left office and was replaced by Eisenhower, but once Stalin died the fighting ended with an armed truce between North and South Korea.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Eisenhower Administration</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Election of 1952</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won the election and took office in 1952.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Domestic Policy, Events, and Advancements</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The McCarthy Hearings</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the midst of the red scare and the nation's fear of communism, McCarthy took advantage of the situation to gain popularity by claiming that he could identify communist spies in the American government, although he rarely had much solid evidence. McCarthy continued to gain popularity as he accused more Americans, politicians, and officials, although he got carried away and finally became disapproved by the nation went he attempted to accuse a well respected American General for sympathizing with the communists. Support for McCarthy and his wild accusations, known as <span style="color: #007fff;">McCarthyism</span>, ended after the hearings of the general and practically going up against the military.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Civil Rights</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Eisenhower made attempts at furthering the progress of civil rights by proposing the desegregation of military schools, which was at first rejected then accepted with the help of Senator Lyndon B. Johnson in Congress. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was also passed, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1960 which was made to help protect the voting rights of African Americans, although both of the laws did not amount to much progress or change in the civil rights situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Board v. Board of Education</span> decision in the Supreme declared that separate was inherently unequal, and thus undoing the decision was established by the Supreme Court in the past in the Plessy v. Ferguson case.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Change in American Society and Life</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The expansion and further development of the highway  system in the U.S. as well as the creation of the suburban housing area known as <span style="color: #007fff;">Levittown</span> were the causes of a great amount of growth in the suburbs of America in the 1950s. There was also success in the economy with a higher amount of research, development, and productivity. Such productivity improvement that came about because of technological advances came at the expense of workers and the amount of jobs available in the economy.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Foreign Policy</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Handling the Cold War</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The concept of <span style="color: #007fff;">massive retaliation</span> was put into effect by Eisenhower's sceretary of state, who supported the idea of threatening the Soviets with an incredibly large force in order to respond to literally any form of Soviet agression, no matter how small. His tactic was a sharp contrast to the previous idea of containment and was a lot more bold and aggressive in its way of keeping the soviets and communism in check. During Eisenhower's presidency, the military buildup along with the supply of nuclear weapons significantly increased.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Middle East</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <span style="color: #007fff;">Eisenhower Doctrine</span> assured that the United States would become personally involved and would intervene in the affairs of the Middle East, with military force if necessary,if the Soviets were to attempt spreading the influence of communism there.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Cuba</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Fidel Castro</span> came to power in Cuba in 1959. His rise in power began the hostility of Cuba toward the U.S., negogiations and agreements with the communists and soviets, as well as the national ownership of business in Cuba, giving Castro and the government a large amount of control over the nation, in contrary to the democratic changes that the U.S. had hoped for the nation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">More on the Cold War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets peaked once again when Khrushchev proposed an idea for a change in the situation of Berlin, Germany, although the United States refused to compromise. War was the expected outcome of the matter, which was known as the second Berlin Crisis, although once the deadline for the offer passed, both nations continued to go about their business despite high hostility and tension without going to war.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Growth and Culture of Cities</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Changing Demographics</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many American were moving toward the urban areas that were concentrated in the Northeast and away from their farms. Americans usually moved from rural to urban societies if their farms were not doing well, or they were unable to compete with the commercial level of production that was becoming common on cars due to additional technology and machinery.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Immigrants</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Poor immigrants in the city tended to live in the slums and cramped apartments downtown that became to known as <span style="color: #007fff;">tenements</span>. The majority of immigrants that came to United states in the late 1800s were from Eastern and Southern Europe. This was unlike the old immigrants that mainly consisted of british, Irish, and German immigrants. the newer immigrants were from countries such as Italy, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Greece, and Croatia. The majority of the immigrants who came from these countries during this time went to the city because of economic crises, market declinations, political reasons, or religious persecution. <span style="color: #007fff;">Political bosses</span> or ward leaders of a city were often of the first people who an immigrant family would meet; and he would generally help them with finding a job or do them other favors in return for their promise to vote for him in the next election. This was one of the main factors that made it possible for political bosses to retain their power despite the corruption that ensued under them. As stated in a previous chapter, political bosses would completely dominated local politics and would also decide who would run for their party in certain office elections. Political Bosses would conduct schemes such as stealing money from taxpayers, and the most notorious was <span style="color: #007fff;">Boss Tweed</span> of New York who was finally exposed by the artist Thomas Nast.  The technology of cable cars as well as the use of horse driven carriages also made it possible to commute across the city.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Problems with Urbanization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Pollution</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Lack of light - Solved emerging technology in illuminations as wells Thomas Edison's lightbulbs</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">•Communication - Solved by emerging technology of the telegraph and also the telephone.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Settlement Houses</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Young educated individuals attempted to learn about the problems of poor working immigrants families and attempting to improve their conditions through experimental housing projects. Jane Addams started the <span style="color: #007fff;">Hull House</span> in Chicago in 1889. The Hull House helped educate immigrants and provide them adequate living conditions. About twenty years later after the construction and success of the Hull House, there were hundreds of settlement houses distributed across American cities.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Religion</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The majority of European immigrants that came to cities in the late 1800 were Roman Catholic, causing the Roman Catholic Churches in America to gain significant followers and support.</p>

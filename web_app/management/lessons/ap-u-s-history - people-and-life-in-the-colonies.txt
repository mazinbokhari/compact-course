<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mercantilism</h2>
The empires of Europe began to base their national power off of their prosperity and wealth as well as the prosperity and wealth that their colonies contributed from trade. To increase the amount of wealth that the colonies contributed to the mother country, England implementing stricter trade policy that was known as the Navigation Acts in 1650.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Navigation Acts</h2>
•Certain products could only be exported to England, such as tobacco.

•All goods that were imported to England had to first pass through ports in England.

•Colonial trade had to be operated by English Ships.

The Navigation Acts helped protect the colonies from other countries with the naval protection of England, although the colonies were payed low prices for goods sold to England while they had to high prices for goods imported from England. The Massachusetts Bay Colony had its charter removed due to a chronic violation of the Acts.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Slavery</h2>
From the Early years of the colonies, the amount of black slaves in the colonies grew at a rapid rate. Virginia had over 100,000 black slaves by 1750. The supply of African slaves seemed limitless, the labor was cheap, and there was less of a chance of revolt with black slaves than there was with immigrant farmers. Slaves had pretty much no rights. Slaves marriages weren't recognized, they couldn't be taught to read or write, they could have no property, and they could be split apart from their families. About 20% of the colonial population of about 2.5 million consisted of slaves in 1775.

German, Scotch-Irish, and Other European immigrants comprised roughly 20% of the colonial population by 1775.   They settled in most colonies excluding the new England colonies because they wished to avoid the Puritan authorities there. English immigrants made up the vast majority of the colonial population, bringing along with them a dominating English culture.

Families were typical large with 8 kids being a typical amount of children for a family. Men were the primary landowners and workers, and they were given extensive limits of power in the home with regard to the treatment of their wives. Women mainly kept to the home, with their primary duties including keeping up the house, cleaning the house, and tending to as well as educating the children.</p>

•New England Colonies: Primarily merchants and shipbuilders.

•Middle Colonies: Small farms and some industry

•Southern colonies:  Subsistence farmers and large plantations

•Transportation: Bodies of water and rivers provided the main method of transporting of goods
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Great Awakening</h2>
In the colonies, there was a religious movements in the 1730s known as the Great Awakening, lead mainly by two ministers, Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield.  Their sermons focused on the idea of people living on the verge of damnation due to their chronic sins, and they must make a change in the way they address their religion in order to be saved. Such sermons were given in any area, such as barns and fields, and one of the more popular ones was known as "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God", which was given by Jonathan Edwards. The movement increased the amount of people following the teachings of evangelical sects.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Education</h2>
Education began to develop in the colonies, with the implementation of multiple grammar schools, high school, and colleges. The New England colonies had the most advanced education system, while the southern colonies primarily relied on the homeschooling of children in order to get educated. Colleges in the colonies included Harvard, the first colonial college, as well as Yale, and William and Mary. All these colleges were sectarian and promoted the teachings of a specific religious sect. The Great Awakening also spurred the establishment of other sectarian colleges such as Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, and Rutgers.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Professions</h2>
The increase in colleges also increased the amount of people practicing more advanced professions such as becoming a physician or lawyer. The first medical college started in 1765. The need for lawyers became apparent as legal complications in court became prevalent, famous lawyers at the time included Patrick Henry and John Adams who would later use legal standing to justify the cause of an American Revolution.

John Locke and Isaac Newton were both leaders in the movement, and Benjamin Franklin also made progress with studies and inventions during this time. Followers of the movements typically believed in God although they believed that all occurrences in life were able to be explained by science.</p>

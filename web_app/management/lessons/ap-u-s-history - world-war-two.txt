<h2 style="text-align: center;">Struggling to Maintain Peace</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the past, there had been multiple times that the nations had tried disarmament and had tried to lower the amount of warships at sea to increase the atmosphere of peace. Once the Japanese seized Manchuria, Hoover refused to address the Japanese as a threat and did not punish them economically. The London Naval Conference of 1931 extended a ban on building ships, although it seemed that hopes for peace were coming to an end with the aggression of Japan and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy was a way of him trying to gain support of nations that would be allies should war come. In the process the United States' role as the interferer of Latin American affairs and the Roosevelt corollary was no longer in effect.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The U.S. and Neutrality</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States passed a series of Neutrality Acts in 1935 which did not allow the United States to export weapons to nations that declared themselves in aggression. An embargo on certain nations could also be allowed, making that nation have to come to American ports to get their goods, although these policies did not differentiate between hostile and friendly nations.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Further German Aggression</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Europe and France tried to avert going to war with German by giving Hitler what he wanted in granting Germany the part of Czechoslovakia that was populated by many Germans. Instead, Hitler took advantage of their proposal and took that part of the nation and eventually had all of Czechoslovakia under his control.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Germany was taking aggressive action on not only Czechoslovakia, but other nations along with help Italy and Japan. These three nations became known as the Axis Powers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">U.S. Cooperation with the Allies</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt made deals with Great Britain known as the destroyer deal and the Lend-Lease, where he gave 50 world war 1 destroyers to Britain in order to be able to build military equipment and weapons for the Britain and France on British land. This deal was made after France and Britain declared war on the axis powers.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">The Atlantic Charter</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Roosevelt and Winston Churchill of England signed the Atlantic Charter which clarified what the nations wanted out of the war, the charter included the destruction of the Nazi Party and territorial conditions. The charter also clarified that then nations wanted what what known as the Four Freedoms: freedom from war, freedom from fear, freedom from the want of seas and the freedom of the seas.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Further Japanese aggresion prompted Roosevelt to cut off oil shipments to Japan, which greatly frustrated and crippled Japan. Japan then prepared to attack the United States, and the U.S. anticipated such an attack from intercepting messages and cracking the Japanese code, but warnings were not heeded in time.The Japanese then attacked and bombed the United States at Peal Harbor on December 7, 1941.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mobilization and War</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Adjustments Back At Home</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The Contribution of Women</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States then mobilized its forces and began a draft. African Americans were still segregated while they set served in the military, and women played an increasingly key role in the economy as they substituted in for many of the jobs that men previously occupied while they were drafted overseas. The amount of women in the workforce increased by about 33% during the war, although their wages were still lowered compared to those received by men.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Internment</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shortly after the mobilization of the United States, about one hundred thousand Japanese Americans, most of which were born in the U.S., were moved to Japanese internment due to the fear of the Japanese in America helping with the Japanese war effort.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Demographic Shifts</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the war, the birthrate rose due to many men marrying before they were drafted overseas to fight in the war. Also, the demographics changed as people moved to find work in areas that were bustling in the type of industry that built war goods. The state that gained the most people during this shift was California, being home to many large shipyards and factories for war materials.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Minorities</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the war, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans also became more involved in the workforce. They moved to cities to find work in the industry, although lower wages for these workers created reason for argument, and discrimination also peaked in violence, notably the <span style="color: #007fff;">Zoot Suit Riots</span> that involved Hispanic workers.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Segregation and Reform in the Industry</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">African Americans began to get fed up with discrimination in the defense industry, and threatened a march on Washington if nothing was done. In response, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which demanded fairer treatment to all workers in the defense industry. The FEPC was also established at this time. His order did not aid African Americans that were serving in the military, or really do much to help with the improvement of treatment these workers received from their co-workers, although it did greatly affect the amount of jobs they were offered.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Funding the War</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The War Production Board oversaw the use of the of the nation's resources during the war, and it was also responsible for the conversion of assembly lines and factors to being able to produce war materials. The United States was able to pay for the war by the sale of war bonds as well as tax increases, although the war still greatly increased the national debt.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">U.S. War Strategy and Fighting the War</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Defeating the Germans</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States first planned on fighting the Germans in Europe and defeating them there before shifting their attention to the Japanese in the Pacific. By 1944, The Allies had won in the North African Front, the Soviets, also part of the Allies, had driven Germany's offensive backward and became the offensive themselves, Italy had been invaded, and the large invasion of Europe on the Allies behalf, in a procedure known as Operation Overlord, took place in the summer of 1944. The invasion was a very bloody battles on the beach known as D-Day, with many lives lost to the intense machine gun fire. After the invasion, the Allies continued their offensive into Germany, Hitler committed suicide in May of 1945, and the Allies won the war.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Defeating the Japanese</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the Germans defeated and the war won in Germany, the United States then formed a strategy to defeat the Japanese in the Pacific. General Douglas MacArthur was in charge of leading the United States through their battle plan in the Pacific islands. The war in the islands was expected to drag on for a considerable amount of time. After failing to negotiate peace with Japanese militants, not so much the Emperor of Japan, the United States then attacked Japan with an atomic bomb on first the city of Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The attack then forced the surrender of the Japanese. The surrender then brought the need for new policies and treaties to the table.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Negotiations, Conferences, and Post-War Treaties</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The idea and plans for a new world wide alliance known as the United Nations to be formed was adopted by the U.S., Britain, USSR, and China at the Dumbarton-Oaks Conference in 1944.The Yalta Conference in 1945 agreed to divided up the militarized zones of Germany into four parts, and the eventual democracy of Poland with the Soviet government overseeing its development until the nation was on its feet. It also planned for a future conference to discuss the formal formation of the United Nations. Stalin also received authority and control of other territories that were involved in the war during the conference. At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the occupation situation of Germany was figured out in depth. Most of Eastern Europe had been turned over to communism at the end of the conferences, and it was point used to criticize Roosevelt and his decisions and agreements made at those conferences. After the war, the United States had firmly established its role as a world superpower with the responsibility of keeping check on the world and promoting peace.</p>
